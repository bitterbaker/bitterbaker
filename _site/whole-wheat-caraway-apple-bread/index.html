    <p>Fruit in breads is not really my thing. I would never eat banana bread. Or banana scones. Or anything that contains mushy, soft bananas. And you’ll probably never find me eating an oatmeal raisin cookie. Or one of those rye dinner rolls that has raisins in it. Whenever I eat traditional christmas <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffron_bun" target="_blank">saffron buns</a> in Sweden, I always pick out the raisins. Or when I’m too lazy to take them out, I swallow them whole so I don’t have to taste it.</p>

<p>Don’t ask me why I’m so weird. I like eating raw bananas. I like raw raisins. It’s just when they come baked in a bun that I cringe.</p>

<p>So apples. I made apple bread once. It was okay. It made my house smell like apple sauce, which was awesome. But it was just <em>weird</em> biting in to a dark rye bread, and all of a sudden there’s just this little piece of apple sweetness. I still believed in the apple thing though, so I took the least sweet apple I could find, grated it and paired it up with caraway seeds. Can’t say I regret it. Turned out caraway and granny smith were like made for each other.</p>

<p><em>The apple taste is not the most distinct flavor, it’s there in the background, but just barely. Most of all, the apple gives the bread an incredible moist.</em></p>

<p><strong>Whole wheat caraway apple bread</strong></p>

<p><em>Total time: 12 hours to let the pre-dough get active. Then another 5-6 hours to let the dough rise and baking the bread. Makes 18 mini loaves or 2 large loaves. </em></p>

<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>

<p>Day 1</p>

<ul>
  <li>75 g (2.6 oz) rye starter</li>
  <li>355 g (12.5 oz, not fluid!) filtered water</li>
  <li>150 g (5.3 oz) whole wheat flour</li>
</ul>

<p>Day 2</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 tbsp sea salt</li>
  <li>1 tbsp honey</li>
  <li>0.5 tbsp caraway seeds</li>
  <li>1 large grated Granny Smith apple</li>
  <li>540 g (19 oz) bread flour</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Toppings</strong></p>

<p>caraway seeds</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<p>Mix rye starter, water and whole wheat flour in a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit in room temperature for 12 hours, until the <a title="What an active pre-dough looks like" href="/what-an-active-pre-dough-looks-like/" target="_blank">pre-dough is active</a>. Add sea salt, honey, crushed caraway seeds, grated apple and bread flour. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and let rise 3-4 hours, until doubled in size. Take out the dough on a floured working bench and shape into 18 mini loaves or 2 large loaves. Put them in greased loaf pans. Let rise 1-2 hours.</p>

<p>Put a casserole dish full of water in the oven and preheat it to 460°F. Brush the loaves with water and sprinkle caraway seeds on top. Bake the mini loaves like this: Bake at 460°F for 15 minutes, then lower the temperature to 390°F and bake for another 10 minutes, until they are golden brown and sound hollow when you knock on the bottom. Bake the large loaves like this: Bake at 460°F for 15 minutes, then lower the temperature to 390°F and bake further until the loaves are done, approximately 15 minutes. Let cool on a rack.</p>

<p><em>So this is a mini loaf. Just saying. I suppose the apple is larger than normal, too.</em></p>

<p><em>It’s whole wheat, too. </em></p>
