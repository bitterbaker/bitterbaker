<p>Since my husband’s family is a giant one (compared to mine; I only have two cousins) we need a lot of bread. So besides the sourdough muffin tops, normal buns are up. Just to make it a little bit more interesting, I added some flaxseeds.</p>

<p><a href="http://bitterbaker.com/?p=143"><img class="pinthis" title="Flaxseed dinner rolls | bitterbaker.com" alt="Flaxseed dinner rolls " src="http://bitterbaker.com/images/normalbuns.jpg" width="700" height="465" /></a></p>

<p><em>I will definitely make these buns again.</em></p>

<p><strong>Flaxseed buns</strong></p>

<p>_Duration: 24 hours for pre-dough to get active. Then 3 hours to let the dough rise and baking the buns.</p>

<p>Makes 16 buns._</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>

<p><em>Day 1</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>195 g white (6.9 oz) sourdough starter</li>
  <li>500 g filtered water (17.6 oz, not fluid!)</li>
  <li>340 g of bread flour (12 oz)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Day 2</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>518 g (18.3 oz) bread flour</li>
  <li>2/3 cup flaxseeds</li>
  <li>1 tbsp sea salt</li>
  <li>2 tbsp honey</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Toppings</strong></p>

<p>sea salt</p>

<p>canola oil</p>

<p><strong>Directions</strong></p>

<p>Mix starter, water and bread flour in a bowl. Wrap the bowl with cling wrap and let sit in room temperature for 24 hours, <a title="What an active pre-dough looks like" href="/what-an-active-pre-dough-looks-like/" target="_blank">until the pre-dough is active, looking bubbly</a>. Add sea salt, honey and flaxseeds. Mix in bread flour until it starts to feel like a dough. Take up the dough on your working bench and knead it further. Divide the dough into 16 pieces. Roll little buns and place on a tray. Let rise for 2 hours.</p>

<p>Put in a casserole dish with half an inch of water in the oven. Preheat it to 460°F and bake the buns for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. The buns should sound hollow when knocking on the bottom.</p>
