    <p>Croissants are one of those things I thought were impossible to make yourself. But when Yuko from over at <a title="A Kitchen Blog" href="http://akitchenblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">A Kitchen Blog</a> (hi again, Yuko!) posted this <a href="http://akitchenblog.wordpress.com/2013/01/24/croissant-sourdough/" target="_blank">sourdough croissant recipe</a>Â â€“ I just had to give it a try. And OMG. They are so delicious! I donâ€™t know who told me that sourdough canâ€™t be used for sweet doughs (it was probably me), but that is a bag, fat lie.</p>

<p>I canâ€™t wait to make them again (oh yes, they are long gone). Maybe with ham and cheese? Or nutella? I should probably stop thinking about croissants now. My mouth is drooling. No, canâ€™t stop. What do you think about truffle croissants? Pesto? Am I nuts? Ooo, wait. Maybe croissants with <em>nuts</em> would be something?</p>

<p><em>These flaky croissants taste wonderful just the way they are, but they certainly go very well together with ALL your favorite toppings.. Cream cheese, roast beef and nutella included.</em></p>

<p><strong>Sourdough croissants</strong></p>

<p><em>Total time: 12-24 hours to make the dough. Then a few more hours to roll out the dough, let it rest in between, and lastly baking the croissants. Makes 12 croissants</em></p>

<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>

<p><em>Day 1</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>145 g (5.1 oz) white starter</li>
  <li>250 g (8.8 oz) filtered water</li>
  <li>415 g (14.6 oz) bread flour</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Day 2</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>3 g (0.1 oz) active dry yeast</li>
  <li>15 g (0.5 oz) warm water</li>
  <li>50 g (1.8 oz) sugar</li>
  <li>0.5 tbsp sea salt</li>
  <li>80 g (2.8 oz) bread flour</li>
  <li>2 sticks of butter at room temperature (2 sticks = 226 g or 8 oz)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Toppings</strong></p>

<p>1 egg (slightly whipped)</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<p>Mix starter, bread flour and water in a bowl to a dough. Take out the dough on a lightly oiled working bench. Give it four sets of stretch and fold treatments (1 set = fold top over bottom, bottom over top, left over right, right over left). Let rest in a lightly oiled bowl for 15 minutes in between each set. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rest in the fridge for 12 hours.</p>

<p>Mix the active dry yeast with the warm water in a small cup. Wait until it is foamy. Take out the dough from the fridge and add yeast water, sugar, salt and bread flour. Mix to a dough that is nice and firm, not too sticky. Let rest in the fridge at least two hours, over overnight.</p>

<p>Take the two sticks of butter and place them in between two sheets of plastic wrap. Roll out the butter to a 6â€³ x 6â€³ square. Roll out the dough to a 12â€³ x 12â€³ square. Place the butter on one half of the dough (donâ€™t forget to take off the plastic ðŸ™‚ ), fold over the other half of the dough and press together the edges of the dough. Roll out the dough to a rectangle, 9â€³ x 19â€³. Fold in thirds, wrap in plastic wrap and let rest in the fridge 1 hour. Repeat this step 3 more times. See pictures here of <a title="How to make croissants" href="/how-to-make-croissants/" target="_blank">how to fold the dough and roll out your croissants</a>.</p>

<p>Roll out the dough to a rectangle, 9â€³ x 19â€³. Cut the dough in triangles, about 4â€³ wide and 9â€³ tall. Let the pieces rest in the fridge 1 hour, then take them out and roll up the croissants (if you donâ€™t want to bake them right away, you can freeze them, or put them in the fridge overnight). Place them on a greased oven tray, peak down, and brush with whipped egg. Let rise for about 2-3 hours, until they are very soft. Brush with more egg right before you bake them. Bake at 425Â°F for 10 minutes, turn down to 375Â°F and bake another 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p><em>P.S. Whenever you want to bake your frozen croissants, just take them out of the freezer, defrost them, then brush with egg and let rise for 2-3 hours, brush with egg again, and then bake.</em></p>

<p><em>Orange juice is the natural drink of choice to accompany your croissant. I guess coffee would be fine, too. And tea. Or champagne.</em></p>
