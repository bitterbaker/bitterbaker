    <p>I think I need to start a little fad. A sourdough crispbread fad. I know people think fads are overrated. But this one is necessary. Believe me.</p>

<p>You can’t tell from the outside, but these thin crispbread dreams are filled with stuff that are just plain good for you. Flaxseed, spelt flour, apple, quinoa, rye flour… The taste is amazing. The caraway seeds definitely do their part, but the mix of quinoa, apple and flaxseed is just to die for. They taste healthy (but not in a bad way), and they make you feel great, too.</p>

<p><em>Do you see how thin and delicate they are? Crispbread excellento, is what their real name should be.</em></p>

<p>I’ve been having mine with a thin layer of cream cheese and some arugula, or with turkey and cottage cheese. Could you imagine a better snack after coming in from a long run? Or after school? Or after work? Or whenever? Didn’t think so.</p>

<p>Another thing I love about crispbread (and that I know that you’ll love too, as soon as you get going on my fad), is the variety you can create. Don’t feel like you need to follow this recipe like a slave. Take out flaxseeds if you don’t like that and replace it with something else. Once you’ve made your first batch of sourdough crispbread you’ll be hooked. I promise.</p>

<p><em>With cream cheese and arugula. Uhm, yes, those are raspberries in the background. I just thought they looked pretty.</em></p>

<p><strong>Healthy quinoa and caraway sourdough crispbread</strong></p>

<p><em>Total time: 24 hours to make the soaker and let the pre-dough get active. Then another 3-4 hours to let the dough rise, and finally 2 hours to roll out the dough and baking the crispbread. Makes a lot of crispbread. </em></p>

<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>

<p><em>Day 1</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>½ cup dry quinoa</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Soaker:</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>1 cup wheat germ</li>
  <li>1 cup oat bran</li>
  <li>½ cup flaxseeds</li>
  <li>90 g (3.2 oz) dark rye flour</li>
  <li>50 g (1.8 oz) spelt flour</li>
  <li>1 tbsp sea salt</li>
  <li>1 tbsp caraway seeds</li>
  <li>2 cups boiling water</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Pre-dough:</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>74 g (2.6 oz) rye starter</li>
  <li>300 g (10.6 oz, not fluid!) filtered water</li>
  <li>300 g (10.6 oz) dark rye flour</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Day 2</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>2 tbsp honey</li>
  <li>1 grated apple</li>
  <li>514 g (18.1 oz) whole wheat flour</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Toppings</strong></p>

<p>sea salt</p>

<p>poppy seeds</p>

<p>sunflower seeds</p>

<p>flaxseeds</p>

<p>sesame seeds</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<p>Cook the quinoa according to the instructions on the package. Let it cool in a bowl and put it in the fridge so it’s ready for the next day when you’re making the dough. Prepare the soaker by first toasting wheat germ, oat bran and flaxseeds in the oven at 375°F for 6-8 minutes. Let it cool and put them in a bowl. Add dark rye flour, spelt flour, caraway seeds and sea salt. Add 2 cups of boiling water and mix well. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it cool in room temperature for 24 hours. Make the pre-dough by mixing rye starter, water and dark rye flour in a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let that too sit in room temperature for 24 hours.</p>

<p>If you have strong arms, go ahead a mix the cooked quinoa, soaker and pre-dough together, but it’s a lot of dough! So if you have a large mixer, I’d suggest using that. My KitchenAid was barely large enough for all the dough, but it worked.. After mixing the three together, add honey, 1 grated apple and whole wheat flour. The dough will be sticky, but that’s okay, you’ll use plenty of flour when you roll it out. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and let the dough rise for 3-4 hours.</p>

<p><em>Flaxseeds, poppy seeds, sea salt, sesame seeds. You’re favorite toppings are calling you.</em></p>

<p>Take a piece of the dough and roll it out to a thin pancake. Use lots of flour! Put the pancake on a greased oven tray and brush of the flour remaining on the top. Brush the dough with water (or use a spray bottle), sprinkle your favorite toppings on top of the dough and then cut it into pieces, in whatever size and shape you like (if you’re patient enough, you can use cookie cutters as well!). <a title="How to make crisp bread" href="/how-to-make-crispbread/" target="_blank">See a picture tutorial on how to make crispbread here</a>. Bake in the middle of the oven at 480°F for 5-8 minutes. Keep an eye on them after 5 minutes, they burn easily! Let the crispbread cool on a rack.</p>

<p>If the crispbread is slightly soft when it has cooled, that’s okay. I usually turn my oven to 170°F and bake them (all of them at once, stacked on top of each other on the oven tray) for another 20-30 minutes, or until they are completely dry.</p>
