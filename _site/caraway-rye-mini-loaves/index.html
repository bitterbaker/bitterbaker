    <p>I love using spices in bread, and this is one of those breads that will make your mouth water. Mine just did, only by thinking of it. First of all, the caraway seeds give the bread that distinct licorice flavor (not too much though, just enough). Molasses gives the bread its darker color and eases up the taste of the sourdough, while the coffee/molasses mixture brushed on top makes the crust chewy and semi-sweet. The light rye flour makes it slightly dense, but it’s still really nice and fluffy.</p>

<p>And it’s so good. So different from normal white bread. It will make your breakfast/sandwich/snack SO much better – more tasty, more flavorful.</p>

<p><em>If you’re like me, you won’t be able to resist that sweet and salty combination from the molasses and the beautiful sea salt crystals.</em></p>

<p><strong>Caraway rye mini loaves</strong></p>

<p><em>Duration: 20 hours to let the pre-dough get active. Then another 4-5 hours to let the dough rise and bake the loaves. Makes 18 mini loaves, or 2 large loaves.</em></p>

<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>

<p><em>Day 1</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>110 g (3.9 oz) rye starter</li>
  <li>540 g (19 oz, not fluid!) filtered water</li>
  <li>290 g (10 oz) bread flour</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Day 2</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>0.5 tbsp sea salt</li>
  <li>¼ cup molasses</li>
  <li>1 tbsp caraway seeds</li>
  <li>1 tsp ground bitter orange (could be left out, if you don’t find it at the store!)</li>
  <li>200 g (7 oz) light rye flour</li>
  <li>350 g (12.3 oz) bread flour</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Toppings</strong></p>

<p>¼ cup cold, strong coffee</p>

<p>1 tbsp molasses</p>

<p>sea salt</p>

<p><strong>Directions</strong></p>

<p>Mix starter, water and bread flour in a bowl. Cover the bowl with cling wrap and let the pre-dough rest in room temperature for about 20 hours, until <a title="What an active pre-dough looks like" href="http://bitterbaker.com/what-an-active-pre-dough-looks-like/" target="_blank">the pre-dough is active, looking nice and bubbly like this</a>. After 20 hours, add sea salt, molasses, crushed caraway seeds (<a title="Someone stole my mortar. What do I use instead?" href="http://bitterbaker.com/someone-stole-my-mortar-what-do-i-use-instead/" target="_blank">if you don’t have a mortar, use your garlic press!</a>) and bitter orange. Then add the flour. Start by adding the light rye flour, then the bread flour.</p>

<p>Take out the dough on your working bench, and shape the dough into 18 mini loaves or 2 large loaves. Let rise for 3 hours, or until they have doubled in size. Put a casserole dish full of water on the lower rack in the oven. Preheat the oven. While the oven is warming up, mix 1/4 cup of cold coffee with 1 tbsp of molasses. Brush the molasses/coffee mixture on the loaves before they go in the oven.</p>

<p>Bake the mini loaves at 480°F for 10 minutes, take out the loaves and brush them with the molasses/coffee mix. Turn the temperature down to 390°F and bake another 10 minutes, take out the loaves again, and brush them another time with the molasses/coffee mixture. This time you can also sprinkle a little sea salt on top if you like. Bake another 10 minutes at 390°F, and take out the loaves when they are done (not sure? <a title="Knock, knock. Who can tell me when my bread is done?" href="http://bitterbaker.com/how-to-know-when-the-bread-is-done/" target="_blank">Find out here on how to know when your bread is done</a>).</p>

<p>Bake the two large loaves at 460°F for 10 minutes. Then take out the loaves and brush them with the molasses/coffee mixture. Turn down the temperature to 390°F and bake for another 30 minutes, brushing the coffee/molasses mixture on the loaves every ten minutes. Sprinkle sea salt on top of the loaves the last time you brush them with the coffee/molasses mixture. Take out the bread when it’s <a title="Knock, knock. Who can tell me when my bread is done?" href="http://bitterbaker.com/?p=198" target="_blank">done</a>.</p>

<p>Let the loaves cool on a rack.</p>

<p><em>The molasses/coffee mixture makes the crust a little shiny and sticky.</em></p>

<p><em>Serve with egg and you’ll have a protein-loaded breakfast!</em></p>
