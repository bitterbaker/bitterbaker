<p>And now. What you’ve all been waiting for… the bread! No matter how greasy the name may sound, it’s actually not that bad. I like greasy pizza every now and then, but mostly I’m just after the taste of sundried tomatoes and the Italian herbs. Which is exactly what you’ll get with this bread. Pizza flavor minus the greasy part. Everybody wins, right?</p>

<p><em>Five different kinds of cheese, and yet it’s not too greasy. Must be a magic bread, or what do you say?</em></p>

<p>I never would have thought of making this loaf, if I hadn’t gotten this comment on my <a title="Pizza monkey bread muffins" href="http://bitterbaker.com/pizza-monkey-bread-muffins/" target="_blank">Pizza monkey bread muffins</a>: “These muffins look great! I wish there was some quicker way to make them <img src="http://bitterbaker.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" />“. I totally understand, sourdough takes a lot of time sometimes – and time is not always something you have plenty of.</p>

<p>So of course, there sure is a quicker way to make them! But since I like trying new kinds of bread, I made this five cheese pizza loaf, which is even quicker than the muffins. All you have to do is throwing the dough in a spring form pan. Can’t be much easier and quicker than that.</p>

<p><em>Make this next time your having an Italian themed dinner.</em></p>

<p>I’m totally in love with this bread. It’s so soft and moist, and literally melts in your mouth when you bite in to it. I warm it up just a tiny bit in the microwave and one, two, three slices later, I don’t even need to think about dinner anymore. After all, it’s called pizza bread.</p>

<p><strong>Five cheese pizza bread</strong></p>

<p><em style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Total time: 2.5 hours. Makes 1 large loaf. </em></p>

<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>2 cups of warm water</li>
  <li>1 tbsp active dry yeast</li>
  <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
  <li>0.5 tbsp sea salt</li>
  <li>2/3 cup chopped sundried tomatoes in oil</li>
  <li>1 tbsp Italian seasoning</li>
  <li>630 g (22.2 oz) bread flour</li>
  <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Toppings</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>1 large egg</li>
  <li>1 cup <a style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;" href="http://www.sargento.com/products/223/sargento-chef-blends-four-state-cheddar-shredded-cheese/" target="_blank">Shredded 4 State Cheddar Cheese</a></li>
  <li>shredded parmesan</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<p>Activate the yeast in the warm water together with the sugar for a few minutes. Add sea salt, sundried tomatoes, italian seasoning and bread flour. Knead to a dough (should remain a little sticky, but not unmanageable). Let the dough rest in its bowl for five minutes, then mix in the olive oil. Let the dough rise until doubled, about 1 hour.</p>

<p>Tip out the dough on a lightly floured working bench. Stretch it out a little and place the egg and the shredded cheese in the middle. Fold the sides over the cheese and egg, so they’re no longer visible. Take a dough cutter and start chopping the dough in little pieces. The egg and the cheese will make it into a gooey mass. When done, place the pieces in a greased 9” spring form pan. Let rise 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Preheat the oven to 350°F. Sprinkle some (or lots of) parmesan cheese on top of the monkey bread and bake for 1 hour.</p>

<p>Let cool in the spring form pan for about 10 minutes. Then take it out of the form and let cool on a rack before you cut in to it – this will allow the dough to cook all the way through and you don’t risk having doughy pizza bread.</p>

<p><em>Looks kind of cool, cutting it like a cake, don’t you think? But it’s not sweet, I promise.</em></p>
