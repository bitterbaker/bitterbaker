    <p>When I grew up, I always wanted to learn how to make real rye bread (as in super dark, compact rye bread). The only place where I would have it growing up was at my grandparents house. I remember eating slices of dark rye bread with butter and cheese on it, while sunflower seeds fell out on the sides. If I wasn’t careful enough, the whole piece of bread could fall apart.

<p><em>Part of my daily diet.</em></p>

<p>Later on in the afternoon I would feel like a grown-up when I was drinking coffee (I was like four years old) with my grandparents. Of course camouflaged with heavy cream and a few spoons of sugar. But still. I had coffee, and it was yummy.</p>

<p><em>Childhood memories.</em></p>

<p>Nowadays I have my coffee black. But I still love rye bread. Since 1 + 1 = 2, coffee and rye might work pretty well together in a loaf of bread, I thought.</p>

<p><em>Made with Swedish coffee, of course.</em></p>

<p>Seriously, this is now one of my favorite breads. Ever. So far I’ve had it with turkey (delicious), tuna + arugula salad (even better), special made eggs with chives and greek yoghurt (aah-mazing), and edamame spread (protein bomb or what?). I can’t seem to find anything that doesn’t go well with this bread.</p>

<p>Now, in case the coffee is freaking you out – it doesn’t <em>ooze</em> with coffee flavor, it’s just there in the background, which is just perfect.</p>

<p><em>One slice a day keeps the doctor away.</em></p>

<p><strong>Rye bread with coffee and molasses</strong></p>

<p><em>Total time: 12 hours to let the pre-dough get active. Then another 9 hours to let the dough ferment and baking the bread. Makes 2 rye loaves. </em></p>

<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>

<p><em>Day 1</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">105 g (3.7 oz) rye starter</span></li>
  <li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">159 g (5.6 oz, not fluid!) filtered water</span></li>
  <li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">159 g (5.6 oz) dark rye flour</span></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Soaker:</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 cup wheat germ</span></li>
  <li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 tbsp sea salt</span></li>
  <li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">½ tbsp caraway seeds</span></li>
  <li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">½ tbsp anise seeds</span></li>
  <li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">½ tbsp fennel seeds</span></li>
  <li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">½ cup flaxseeds</span></li>
  <li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">½ cup flaxseed meal</span></li>
  <li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 cup rolled oats</span></li>
  <li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">½ cup sunflower seeds</span></li>
  <li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">2 cups boiling water</span></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Day 2</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">¼ cup molasses</span></li>
  <li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">2 tbsp honey</span></li>
  <li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">½ cup cold coffee</span></li>
  <li><span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">368 g (13 oz) whole wheat flour</span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Toppings</strong></p>

<p>wheat germ</p>

<p>oats</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<p>Mix starter, water and flour in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Make the soaker by mixing all the dry ingredients, then adding and mixing well with the boiling water. Cover that bowl too with plastic wrap (without letting the soaker cool). Let both the starter and the soaker rest in room temperature for 12 hours.</p>

<p><em>Makes an excellent companion for tuna and arugula.</em></p>

<p>Add starter and soaker together in a bowl. Add molasses, honey, coffee, whole wheat flour and work the dough for about 10 minutes in a kitchen mixer, or at least 15-20 minutes by hand. Cover the bowl with the plastic wrap and let rest in room temperature for 6 hours.</p>

<p>Take out the dough on a floured surface and divide it in two pieces. Shape into two loaves and place in greased loaf pans that have been dusted with wheat germ. Let rise covered with a kitchen towel for three hours, until the loaves have doubled in size.</p>

<p>Preheat the oven to 500°F. Brush the loaves with water and sprinkle some rolled oats on top. Spray some water on the bottom of the oven and bake the bread for 15 minutes. Open the oven to let some steam out. Lower the temperature to 390°F and continue baking for 45 minutes.</p>

<p>Take the loaf out of the pan and bake another 10 minutes, this time at 355°F.</p>

<p>Let cool on a rack.</p>
