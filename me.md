I&#8217;m Yvonne, the bitter baker behind this blog. Having a hard time imagining a 25-year-old being bitter? Let me tell you how it all started.

My journey to becoming a bitter baker is pretty straight forward. I didn&#8217;t start making bread because I loved it so much. I started baking bread because it&#8217;s cheaper than buying it.

It&#8217;s not the most terrible thing in the world though, and sometimes, I have to admit, I really do like it. And since I want to remember at least some of the recipes that I make, I thought I&#8217;d write them down in a blog. Just to keep track, you know. Like a public Google Document (except you can&#8217;t go in and edit the recipes. Sorry about that).

Apart from that, I&#8217;m from the Scandinavian country with the blue and yellow flag. Besides blogging, I: work (with people) and does an internship (in the PR field). I also like running climbing and hiking in the woods surrounding Seattle.

P.S. I might be a bitter baker, but I&#8217;m a pretty happy person. So don&#8217;t hesitate to shoot me an email if you have any questions!Â <yvonne@bitterbaker.com>
