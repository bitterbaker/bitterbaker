I couldn’t help but making more grissinis (and to give you heads up, there might be even more tomorrow). Apart from being really tasty, they’re convenient, too. You can make however many you want and keep them in a container with a lid on, and they will last a long time (unless you eat them all).

I just have one problem with them.

Okay, fine. I have two.

1. Can you imagine how long it takes to roll (and bake) 100 grissinis?

2. I don&#8217;t have a container that&#8217;s long enough for them.

_These would be perfect for a dinner party. A good tip is to make them the day before, as they do demand some time._

**Rosemary grissini**

_Duration: 24 hours for pre-dough to get active. Then 5-6 hours to let the dough rise and making the grissinis._
  
_Makes up to 100 thin grissinis._

**Ingredients**
  
_Day 1_

  * 115 g (4 oz) white starter
  * 400 g (14 oz, not fluid!) filtered water
  * 200 g (7 oz) bread flour

  * 6-7 stems fresh rosemary
  * ½ cup olive oil

_Day 2_

  * 1 tbsp sea salt
  * 1 tbsp honey
  * 450 g (15.9 oz) bread flour

**Toppings**
  
sea salt
  
fresh rosemary

**Directions**
  
Mince the fresh rosemary and marinate it in the olive oil. Cover and let sit for 24 hours. Make the pre-dough by mixing white starter, water and bread flour. Wrap the bowl with plastic wrap and let sit for 24 hours until the <a title="What an active pre-dough looks like" href="http://bitterbaker.com/what-an-active-pre-dough-looks-like/" target="_blank">pre-dough is active, looking nice and bubbly</a>.

Add sea salt, honey and bread flour. Let the dough rest 2-3 hours. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Divide the dough into little pieces. Roll out each piece so that it measures about 10 inches long, and ¼ of an inch wide. Put the grissinis on greased oven trays, brush them with water and sprinkle on your toppings. Bake in the oven for a total of ca. 20-25 minutes (turn the grissinis after 15 minutes to get an even golden brown color).

Let cool on a rack.

_Top it off with some fresh rosemary or sea salt, and they&#8217;re good to go._
