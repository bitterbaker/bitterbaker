When I first started writing this I was going to tell you that these are authentic Swedish cinnamon rolls. Thatâ€™s not entirely true. Real (Swedish) cinnamon rolls have pearl sugar on top. These donâ€™t.

_Either roll them up like normal cinnamon rolls, or make these cute <a title="How to roll a twirly top" href="/how-to-roll-a-twirly-top/" target="_blank">twirly tops</a>._ 

Other than that theyâ€™re pretty close to the real deal. But theyâ€™re kind of different from the American cinnamon sticky buns. Some of my friends recall them as those â€œmuffin things you made beforeâ€œ. But even so, theyâ€™re soft and buttery like â€œnormalâ€œ cinnamon rolls. Dare I say that they go even better with a cup of coffee? I think I do, but that&#8217;s just my opinion.

_You have to try them with a glass of milk at least once in your life._ 

You think I&#8217;m biased? You&#8217;re probably right. So you should just see for yourself.

Your house will smell like heaven when youâ€™re done. Just saying.

**Swedish cinnamon rolls (kanelbullar)**
  
_Total time: 2-2,5 hours. Makes about 44 cinnamon rolls._

**Ingredients**

  * 0,5 l milk (17.6 oz, not fluid! or slightly more than 2 cups)
  * 2 tsp active dry yeast
  * 1,5 stick butter (170 g)
  * a pinch of salt
  * Â½ cup sugar
  * 1 tsp ground cardamom
  * 1 egg
  * 800-850 g (28.2-30 oz) all-purpose flour, take as much as you need â€“ you don&#8217;t want a sticky dough.

 **Filling**

  * 1,5 stick (170 g) of butter, room temperature
  * 1.5â€“2 tbsp ground cinnamon
  * Â¾ cup sugar

 **Toppings**
  
1 egg
  
sliced almonds

_I dare you to only eat one.. ðŸ˜‰_

**Instructions**
  
Heat up the milk to about 110-115 Â°F. Dissolve the active dry yeast in the milk and let it sit for a few minutes. Melt the butter and mix in with the milk. Add a pinch of salt, sugar, cardamom, egg and flour. Mix to a dough. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and let rise until double the size, about 1 hour. Mix the ingredients for the filling in a bowl and set aside in room temperature.

Roll out half of the dough (unless you have a really large working bench; then you can roll out the whole thing) to a large, thin rectangle. Spread half of the filling over the rectangle (or all of it if you rolled out all of the dough), then either roll up the dough to a cylinder and cut the dough in half an inch thick slices, or make these <a title="How to roll a twirly top" href="/how-to-roll-a-twirly-top/" target="_blank">twirly tops</a>. Place the cinnamon rolls in muffin forms and put them on an oven tray. Now roll out the second half of the dough and do the same thing.

Let the rolls rise for another 30 minutes (up to 1 hour is okay) while you preheat the oven to 460Â°F. Brush the rolls with egg and sprinkle some sliced almonds on top. Bake for about 10-14 minutes until they are golden brown.

Let cool on a rack with a kitchen towel on top. Now treat yourself to a Swedish fika (coffee break) with a cup of coffee or a cold glass of milk ðŸ™‚

_My husband said he felt really Swedish (he&#8217;s not from Sweden) when eating cinnamon rolls and drinking coffee on a break from studying. Let me know how it makes you feel!_
