The first bread cookbook that I ever got (that is, one out of two) was <a href="http://www.adlibris.com/se/bok/brod-fran-bagels-till-tunnbrod-9789153428954" target="_blank">Bröd: från bagels till tunnbröd</a>, which kind of translates into _Bread: from bagels to flatbreads_. This coconut bread is inspired from this book, although while the original recipe calls only for all-purpose flour, I thought it&#8217;d be fun to switch it up with some spelt.

_Coconut bread with fresh cilantro, mmm.._ 

You wouldn&#8217;t believe what an interesting flavor the coconut milk gives the bread! It&#8217;s kind of amazing. My husband&#8217;s first reaction was &#8220;wow&#8221; (in a good way, I&#8217;d like to add). The bread is on the flatter side, so I had mine as a side to a bowl of soup.

_Works great as a side for soup._ 

**Coconut cilantro spelt bread**
  
_Total time: 2.5 hours. Makes 4 small loaves_

**Ingredients**
  
1 tbsp active dry yeast
  
3 tbsp warm water (110-115°F)
  
1 can coconut milk (the fatty, not the light kind!)
  
1 cup yoghurt
  
2 tbsp fresh minced cilantro
  
1 tbsp sea salt
  
500 g (17.6 oz) spelt flour
  
150 g (5.6 oz) all-purpose flour

**Toppings**
  
shredded coconut

**Instructions**
  
Activate the dry yeast in the warm water. Add coconut, yoghurt, cilantro, salt and spelt flour. Add the all-purpose flour, a little at a time, until you have a firm dough that is not sticky. Let the dough rise in the bowl covered with a kitchen towel until it has doubled in size, approximately 45 minutes.

Shape the dough into four round loaves and place on greased oven trays. Let rise covered with a kitchen towel for 1 hour, or until they have doubled in size.

Preheat the oven to 485°F. Spray some water on the bottom of the oven and put in the loaves. Decrease the temperature immediately to 410°F and bake for 25-30 minutes. When 10 minutes remain, sprinkle some shredded coconut on top of the loaves (if you quickly brush some water on top before, it will stick better). Let the bread cool on a rack.

Enjoy!
