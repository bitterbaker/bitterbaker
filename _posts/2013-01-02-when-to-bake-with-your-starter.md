Let&#8217;s say you fed your starter 24 hours ago, and you&#8217;re just about to feed it again. This is when you want to bake with it. Take some starter out of the jar before you feed it, put in a bowl and follow [one of these recipes](http://bitterbaker.com/?cat=10). Then feed the rest of the remaining starter in the glass jar, putting a lid on it (or some cling wrap with a rubber band around it).

Why you do this is because you want your starter to be &#8220;hungry&#8221; when you bake with it. Take a look [here](/how-to-feed-your-starter/ "Iâ€™m hungry! (or how to feed your starter)") to see how often, and with what flour/water ratio to feed your starter.
