Wherever I look it seems like people are always _stretching and folding_ their dough. Everywhere! And from looking at the pictures, it seems like this is the secret to baking perfect bread.

Of course, I don&#8217;t want to be any worse than anybody else, so I decided I would try and give my dough a little stretch and fold treatment, to see if it made any difference.

And it _did_. I almost, almost got that blistered crust that all artisan-fancy bread has. Next time I&#8217;ll stretch and fold my dough a little more.

(I actually invested in a [scraper](https://www.google.com/search?q=bread+scraper&hl=en&tbo=u&source=univ&tbm=shop&sa=X&ei=smXwUJKuIO33igLk-IEw&ved=0CEwQsxg&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&bvm=bv.1357700187,d.cGE&biw=1272&bih=702&ech=1&psi=smXwUJKuIO33igLk-IEw.1357933121353.3&emsg=NCSR&noj=1&ei=smXwUJKuIO33igLk-IEw) before baking. It would have been really hard to drag and fold the sticky dough without a scraper. So now I’ve added a scraper to my [Things to keep in your kitchen](http://bitterbaker.com/?p=200)!)

_Okay, okay. I know you can&#8217;t see the tiny spots of blistered crust, but it&#8217;s there. I promise._ 

**Flaxseed baguettes**

_Duration: 12 hours to let poolish rise. Then 9-12 hours to make the dough and let it rise in the fridge. Plus 5 hours to let the baguettes rise and bake them in the oven. Total ca. 30 hours._ 
  
_Makes 4 baguettes._ 

**Ingredients**
  
_Step 1_, p_oolish:_

  * 135 g (4.8 oz) white starter
  * 500 g (17.6 oz, not fluid!) filtered water
  * 400 g (14 oz) bread flour

_Step 2_

  * 1 tbsp sea salt
  * 2 tbsp honey
  * 0.5 cup flaxseed
  * 0.5 cup canola oil
  * 400 g (14 oz) bread flour

**Toppings**
  
flour

**Directions**
  
Mix white starter, water and bread flour to make the [poolish](http://bitterbaker.com/?p=240). Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let sit 9-12 hours, <a title="What a poolish should look like" href="http://bitterbaker.com/what-a-poolish-should-look-like/" target="_blank">until the poolish has risen and is bubbly</a>. Mix in sea salt, honey, flaxseed, canola oil and bread flour. It should be pretty sticky! Take out the dough on your counter and use a scraper to stretch and fold it for 5 minutes. Let it rest in a bowl for 45 minutes, then take it out and stretch and fold it for another 10 minutes. Let it rest for 45 minutes and stretch and fold it for 10 minutes. Let it rest for 45 minutes, then stretch and fold it a fourth time for 10 minutes. Put a towel on top of the bowl and let it rest in the fridge, 9-12 hours. Take out the bowl and let it rest in room temperature about 2 hours.

Take out the dough on your working bench. Divide it into four parts and shape into baguettes (it&#8217;s not a bad idea to google a few videos on this topic). Roll in flour and place on an oven tray to let them rise until they have almost doubled in size, about 2 hours.

Put a casserole dish full of water in the oven and preheat the oven to 460° F. Score the baguettes with a sharp knife and bake them for about 15 minutes. Then lower the heat to 390°F and continue baking until they are golden brown, about 15 minutes. See here to <a title="Knock, knock.
