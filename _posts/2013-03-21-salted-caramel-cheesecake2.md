<strong style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Ingredients</strong>
  
_Crust_

  * 6 tbsp butter
  * 1.5 cups crumbled graham crackers

 _Cheesecake_

  * 1.5 packages of cream cheese, 12 oz.
  * 0.5 cup dark brown sugar
  * 0.5 cup heavy whipping cream
  * 0.5 cup sour cream
  * 1 tbsp maple syrup
  * 3 eggs

 _Salted caramel sauce_

  * 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream
  * Almost ½ cup (1 dl) dark brown sugar
  * ½ stick of butter
  * 0.5 tsp sea salt
  * Almost ½ cup (1 dl) maple syrup

**Instructions**
  
Bring a large pot of water to a boil (we will use it for the waterbath later) and preheat the oven to 350°F. Melt the butter and mix with the crumbled graham crackers. Press out the butter/graham mix in a 9” spring form pan. Bake at 350°F for 10 minutes.

Whip the cream cheese light and fluffy with a electric beater. Mix in sugar and maple syrup. Add sour cream and whipping cream, and beat a little further. Finally add the eggs, 1 egg at a time. Beat with the electric beater in between each added egg.

_The best of two worlds – salted caramel and cheesecake._ 

Turn down the oven temperature to 325°F. Pour the cream cheese batter in the spring form pan on top of the graham crust. Take aluminum foil and cover the bottom and the sides of the spring form pan.

Place the spring form pan in a large oven tray or an oven pan which sides go up at least half the height of the spring form pan. Put the oven pan/tray in the oven with the spring form in it. Take the boiling water and carefully pour it in the oven pan, so that the water reaches up to half the height of the form. Bake the cheesecake in the water bath at 325°F for about 70 minutes. The cheesecake should still be loose when you take it out. When you’ve taken out the pan, let the cheesecake cool in the water bath for 15 minutes, then take it out of the water and let it cool on a rack. Chill in the fridge for at least 8 hours or overnight. Don’t skip this step! The cheesecake really needs to be thoruoughly chilled in order to get the right consistency. If you eat it before that, it might be foamy.

_Irresistible._ 

When the cheesecake is cooling, prepare the salted caramel sauce by putting all the ingredients in a pot. Bring to a boil and let simmer 18 minutes, until it has slightly thickened. Stir every once in a while. Let cool, but don’t put it in the fridge. That will just make it stiffen.

When the cheesecake has cooled, remove it from the spring form pan and pour the salted caramel sauce on top. Voilà, done!

_I like to sprinkle a little bit of salt on top for that extra finish. _
