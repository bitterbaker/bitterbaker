_Part of my daily diet._ 

**Instructions**
  
Mix starter, water and flour in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Make the soaker by mixing all the dry ingredients, then adding and mixing well with the boiling water. Cover that bowl too with plastic wrap (without letting the soaker cool). Let both the starter and the soaker rest in room temperature for 12 hours.

Add starter and soaker together in a bowl. Add molasses, honey, coffee, whole wheat flour and work the dough for about 10 minutes in a kitchen mixer, or at least 15-20 minutes by hand. Cover the bowl with the plastic wrap and let rest in room temperature for 6 hours.

_Made with Swedish coffee, of course._ 

Take out the dough on a floured surface and divide it in two pieces. Shape into two loaves and place in greased loaf pans that have been dusted with wheat germ. Let rise covered with a kitchen towel for three hours, until the loaves have doubled in size.

_One slice a day keeps the doctor away._ 

Preheat the oven to 500°F. Brush the loaves with water and sprinkle some rolled oats on top. Spray some water on the bottom of the oven and bake the bread for 15 minutes. Open the oven to let some steam out. Lower the temperature to 390°F and continue baking for 45 minutes.
  
Take the loaf out of the pan and bake another 10 minutes, this time at 355°F.

Let cool on a rack.

_Makes an excellent companion for tuna and arugula._
