Day 1

  * 75 g (2.6 oz) rye starter
  * 355 g (12.5 oz, not fluid!) filtered water
  * 150 g (5.3 oz) whole wheat flour

Day 2

  * 1 tbsp sea salt
  * 1 tbsp honey
  * 0.5 tbsp caraway seeds
  * 1 large grated Granny Smith apple
  * 540 g (19 oz) bread flour

**Toppings**
  
caraway seeds

**Instructions**
  
Mix rye starter, water and whole wheat flour in a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit in room temperature for 12 hours, until the <a title="What an active pre-dough looks like" href="/what-an-active-pre-dough-looks-like/" target="_blank">pre-dough is active</a>. Add sea salt, honey, crushed caraway seeds, grated apple and bread flour. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and let rise 3-4 hours, until doubled in size. Take out the dough on a floured working bench and shape into 18 mini loaves or 2 large loaves. Put them in greased loaf pans. Let rise 1-2 hours.

Put a casserole dish full of water in the oven and preheat it to 460°F. Brush the loaves with water and sprinkle caraway seeds on top. Bake the mini loaves like this: Bake at 460°F for 15 minutes, then lower the temperature to 390°F and bake for another 10 minutes, until they are golden brown and sound hollow when you knock on the bottom. Bake the large loaves like this: Bake at 460°F for 15 minutes, then lower the temperature to 390°F and bake further until the loaves are done, approximately 15 minutes.

_So this is a mini loaf. Just saying. I suppose the apple is larger than normal, too._

_The apple taste is not the most distinct flavor, it&#8217;s there in the background, but just barely. Most of all, the apple gives the bread an incredible moist._
