Mix starter, water and bread flour in a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit in room temperature for about 16-24 hours, until the pre-dough is active, <a title="What an active pre-dough looks like" href="/what-an-active-pre-dough-looks-like/" target="_blank">looking nice and bubbly like this</a>.

Toast the sunflower seeds in the oven on broil until they are lightly brown. Add sea salt, honey, flaxseeds, sunflower seeds and bread flour to the pre-dough. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and let rest in room temperature for about 2-3 hours, until it has doubled in size.

_I love eating my rolls as a light afternoon meal, with arugula, tomatoes and some salt and pepper. Doesn&#8217;t get much better than that._ 

Take out the dough on a floured surface. Divide the dough in 16 pieces. Roll each piece to a little ball, dip the bottom in flour and place on a greased oven tray. Cover the rolls with a kitchen towel and let rise until they have doubled in size, about 2 hours.

Preheat the oven to 460F. Brush the rolls with canola oil. Sprinkle sea salt and sunflower seeds on top. Put the rolls in the oven and spray some water on the bottom of the oven. Bake the rolls for 15-20 minutes at 460F.

_Arugula, cottage cheese, red onion, salt and pepper makes another great combination.Â _
