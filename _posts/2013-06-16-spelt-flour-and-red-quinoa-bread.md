I&#8217;ve been having so much quinoa lately that I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s going to start squirting out of my ears soon. It didn&#8217;t make it better that I felt the need to make a bread with quinoa in it. What if my skin turns red (I&#8217;ve been having red quinoa)?

_Bread in a healthier version._ 

I suppose that&#8217;ll have to be a later problem, because I already baked my special quinoa bread. I switched it up this time using some spelt flour instead of regular bread flour, and I really like the change. Spelt flour has more of a nutty taste to it (and is supposedly a little bit healthier).

The smell of this fresh loaf is amazing, too. For some reason it made me think of Greece. Turquoise water, white sand, greek salads, bread and water melon. Can&#8217;t say the loaf disappointed me in that regard, even though I was looking out the window at gray skies and wasn&#8217;t anywhere near a white, sandy beach.

_Maybe it doesn&#8217;t look that Greek. But it smelled like it. Which is a good thing._

**Spelt flour and red quinoa bread**

_Total time: 16-24 hours to let the pre-dough get active. Then another 4-5 hours to let the dough rise and baking the bread. Makes 1 loaf._ 

**Ingredients**
  
_Day 1_

  * ½ cup dry red quinoa

  * <span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">55 g (1.9 oz) white starter</span>
  * <span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">249 g (8.8 oz, not fluid!) filtered water</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;"> </span>
  * <span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">166 g (5.9 oz) bread flour</span>

_Day 2_

  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 tbsp sea salt</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 tbsp honey</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">256 g (9 oz) spelt flour</span>

**Toppings**
  
wheat bran

_Like always, one of my favorite toppings on bread is arugula and avocado. This time with a little bit of cream cheese. _

**Instructions**
  
Pre-cook the red quinoa according to the instructions on the package. Let cool in the fridge. Mix starter, water and bread flour in a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit in room temperature for 16-24 hours until the pre-dough is active, looking nice and bubbly.

Mix in sea salt, honey, spelt flour and the cooked quinoa in the pre-dough. Flour a bread basket with lots of flour, and place the round dough in there. If you don&#8217;t have a bread basket, just shape your dough into a round loaf. Sprinkle wheat bran on the bottom of the loaf (if it&#8217;s in the bread basket), or on top of the loaf if it&#8217;s on an oven tray, and let rise for 3 hours, until it has doubled in size.

Preheat the oven to 500°F. If your dough was in a bread basket, turn the bread basket upside down and tip out the dough onto a greased oven tray. Spray some water on the bottom of the oven and bake the loaf for 15 minutes. Turn down the temperature to 390°F and bake another 40 minutes, until the loaf is cooked all the way through. If the bottom of the crust isn&#8217;t golden brown, but the loaf is cooked all the way through – just turn the loaf upside down and bake it for another 5 minutes.

_Pair with a grapefruit and you got yourself a perfectly healthy breakfast, or afternoon meal._
