_Cream cheese, arugula, avocado and black pepper. A perfect combination._

**Instructions**
  
Mix starter, water and dark rye flour in a bowl. Wrap with cling wrap. Roast the sunflower seeds in the oven on broil (keep an eye on them so that they don&#8217;t burn!). Mix the roasted sunflower seeds with the boiling water and salt for the Soaker 1 and wrap the bowl with cling wrap. Prepare Soaker 2 by mixing dark rye flour, boiling water and salt in a third bowl. Wrap with cling wrap. Let all three bowls stand in room temperature for 16 hours.

_Healthy addition to any meal._

Active the dry yeast in 1 tbsp of warm water. Mix together the two soakers and the pre-dough with the yeast, honey and bread flour. Let a stand mixer work the dough for 7 minutes. If you do this by hand, work the dough for at least 15-20 minutes. It will be really sticky. Cover the bowl with cling wrap and let it rest 30 minutes.

_This is my favorite thing to eat when I get home from a day at work._

Butter a loaf pan and sprinkle some sunflower seeds on the bottom and the sides. Let the stand mixer work the dough again for 7 minutes, then put the dough in the loaf pan. Cover the pan with a kitchen towel and let the dough rise for 2-3 hours in room temperature, until it reaches the top of the loaf.

_Cottage cheese, tomato and black pepper. Another great addition to this dark rye loaf._

Preheat the oven to 485F. Put the loaf in on the lower rack. Spray some water on the bottom of the oven and bake the loaf 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, open the oven to let out some steam. Lower the temperature to 350F and bake another 45 minutes. Then tip out the loaf on an oven tray, and bake another 20 minutes, to get a nice crust all around.

Let cool on a rack.

_The loaf stays fresh for a really long time. Just keep it wrapped in a kitchen towel._
