If you love toffee, caramel, maple syrup and soft, chewy cookies; you will love these!

They are actually my favorite kind of cookies, and it&#8217;s one of those recipes that I go back to over and over again. They are so easy to make, and so quick – they&#8217;ll be done before you know it.

But. They won&#8217;t only be done before you know it, they&#8217;ll be gone before you know it, too. I made these for dessert the other night at the same time as we were cooking dinner (I want to say that we were having some fancy chicken with quinoa, French cheeses, white wine and fresh oregano, but it was just pasta, hot dogs, ketchup and mustard). I, for my part, had so much cookie dough, that I completely lost my appetite. My better half, on the other hand, didn&#8217;t even notice that I was making cookies until after dinner (no, I don&#8217;t understand how that&#8217;s possible either), so he didn&#8217;t spare any room for dessert.

But neither of us, no matter how full we were, could resist the smell and chewiness of the toffee cookies. By the end of the night, they were all gone. All of them. I might have had a really full stomach. It was totally worth it.

_Chewy, with a sweet hint of maple syrup._

**Toffee cookies**
  
_Duration: 30 minutes. __Makes 25-30 cookies._

**Ingredients**
  
1 stick butter (113 g)
  
1 cup all-purpose flour
  
1 tsp baking powder
  
½ cup sugar
  
1/3 cup maple syrup

**Toppings**
  
sliced almonds

**Directions**
  
Preheat the oven to 390°F. Mix butter, maple syrup and sugar in a bowl. In another bowl, mix flour and baking powder. Add the flour mix to the butter mix and blend to a cookie dough. Grease an oven tray and shape the dough into two long rectangular shapes. Each shape should be about as long as the oven tray itself and 2 inches wide. Press down on the dough with your fingers so that the shapes are about 1/2 inch high. Sprinkle sliced almonds on top. Bake in the oven for about 15 minutes. They should still be a little soft when you take them out. While they are still warm, cut them into thin rectangular shapes, about 1 inch wide (they will have perfect length if you slice the two rows of dough the way you normally slice a loaf of bread, sideways). Let cool.
