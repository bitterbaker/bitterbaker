Rye is a grateful kind of flour to use for your starter. It almost always works and, as a plus, you can use the active starter to make your own [wheat starter](http://bitterbaker.com/?p=213). Always use filtered water.

Here&#8217;s how I make my rye starter from scratch:

<li style="text-align: left;">
  Mix 100 g (3.5 oz, not fluid!) of water, 50 g (1.7 oz) of dark rye flour and 1 tbsp of honey in a tall, clean glass jar.
</li>

</p>

  * Cover with a lid, or plastic wrap and a rubber band.

</p>

  * Let sit 12 hours. Stir and cover with lid or plastic wrap.
  * Let sit another 12 hours, then add 50 g (1.7 oz, not fluid!) water and 50 g (1.7 oz) of dark rye flour.
  * Cover with lid or plastic wrap and let sit 24 hours.
  * During these 24 hours, the starter will rise and start to look foamy and bubbly, like the pictures below. It will then collapse, looking more dense. When this happens, the starter is ready to bake with (see [When to bake with your starter](http://bitterbaker.com/?p=204)). If it doesn&#8217;t happen, then pour some of the starter out, add 50 g (1.7 oz, not fluid!) water and 50 g (1.7 oz) dark rye flour and let sit for another 24 hours. See instructions [here](http://bitterbaker.com/?p=202) on how to feed your starter once it&#8217;s active.
