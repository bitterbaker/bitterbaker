First off, we have a winner for the <a title="Coffee ice cream blackberry meringue cake and Laughing Man Coffee Giveaway" href="/coffee-ice-cream-blackberry-meringue-cake-and-laughing-man-coffee-giveaway-2/" target="_blank">Laughing Man Coffee Giveaway</a>Â (you know who you are!). This was so much fun, and it makes me really happy to share something so delicious. And just because coffee makes me so happy, I thought I&#8217;d follow up the giveaway with another coffee recipe ðŸ™‚

_Nuts, nuts, nuts!_

Isn&#8217;t it weird how things that start with the same letter go really well together? Think about it. Almonds and apricot, for example. Or chili and chocolate. Hashbrowns and hazelnuts (just kidding! or hmm, maybe we should give it a go??).

But seriously, coffee, cocoa and coconut? Now, that&#8217;s a winner. Say you had this granola for breakfast. You get twice the caffeine without even thinking about it! Now, that&#8217;s being effective.

_Made with <a href="http://www.livelaughingman.com/splash.html" target="_blank">Laughing Man Coffee</a>._ 

It&#8217;s not like you&#8217;re chewing on a bunch of coffee pellets though, the coffee flavor is kind muffled between all the other yummy stuff &#8211; roasted hazelnuts, almonds, cashews, walnuts, sunflower seeds&#8230; I think I actually put in every nut and seed that I could find at home. It has happened that I&#8217;ve just grabbed a hand-full and snacked on it. It&#8217;s really good just on its own.

_It&#8217;s really good on it&#8217;s own, but you can honestly serve it any way you want to._ 

**Coffee coconut cocoa granola**
  
_Total time: 35 minutes._ 

**Ingredients**

  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">2 cups rolled hot cereal</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">2 cups oats</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Â½ cup flaxseeds</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Â½ cup sunflower seeds</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Â½ cup walnut pieces</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Â½ cup cashew pieces</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Â½ cup chopped hazelnuts</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Â½ cup chopped almonds</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 tbsp cocoa</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">2 tbsp honey</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Â¼ cup canola oil</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 cup strong coffee (I used 4-5 tbsp for 1 cup water)</span>

**Instructions**
  
Preheat the oven to 390Â°F. Mix all the dry ingredients in a bowl. Add water and canola oil. Spread out an even layer of granola on two oven trays. Roast in the oven for 30 minutes. Stir after every ten minutes, and keep an eye on the granola when five minutes remain, you donâ€™t want to burn it! Let cool on the trays.

Enjoy!

_Oh, you know me. Always gotta serve granola with some fruit. Or berries._
