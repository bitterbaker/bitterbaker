It was totally random that I came across <a title="Sourdough Surprises" href="http://www.sourdoughsurprises.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Sourdough Surprises</a>. I was reading this post from Korena in the Kitchen – <a href="http://korenainthekitchen.com/2013/07/20/colossal-sourdough-cinnamon-buns/" target="_blank">Colossal Sourdough Cinnamon Buns</a> (I know right, how good does that sound?!). Which by the way has mashed potatoes in them. One thing led to another and there I was, at the Sourdough Surprises website. How could I have missed this?

_The saffron gives the crackers a beautiful yellow color._

Well, I&#8217;m not missing anything anymore, that&#8217;s for sure. So I went ahead and looked at the challenge. We&#8217;re making crackers. Crackers. Yesss! I love crackers. This surprise thing is right up my alley.

_Oh, and the saffron gives them a pretty awesome flavor too. Perfect companion to cheese._

Crackers are so fun and easy to make, and these ones are especially delicious and crunchy thanks to all the almond flour in them. They&#8217;re not sweet, but not really savory, either. I served them with blue cheese and brie. Oh my. Turns out saffron + almond + blue cheese were made for each other. Perfectly balanced flavors. Nutty almonds, lean saffron and a spark of blue cheese. You&#8217;ll know what I mean when you try it.

_Sprinkle some almond flour or sliced almonds on top. Whatever your prefer._ 

**Saffron almond sourdough crackers**
  
_Total time: 24 hours to let the pre-dough get active. Then another 3-4 hours to let the dough rise and baking the crackers._

**Ingredients**
  
_Day 1_

  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">100 g (3.5 oz) white starter (100 % hydration)</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">150 g (5.3 oz, not fluid!) filtered water</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">150 g (5.3 oz) all-purpose flour</span>

_Day 2_

  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 g (0.03 oz) saffron</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 tsp sea salt</span>

_Creamy blue cheese&#8230; Mmm!!! is all I have to say. I think I may have said that already. Oh well._ 

**Instructions**
  
Mix starter, water and flour in a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let ferment in room temperature for 24 hours until the pre-dough is active. Crush the saffron in a mortar and add to the pre-dough along with the sea salt, honey, almond flour and all-purpose flour. Mix to a firm dough that doesn’t stick to the sides of the bowl. Cover with a kitchen towel and let rise for 2-3 hours, until double its size.

_They&#8217;ll be gone before you know it!_

Preheat the oven to 450°F. Take out the dough on a floured surface. Cut off a little piece and roll it out to a thin (super thin!) pancake. <a title="How to make crisp bread" href="/how-to-make-crispbread/" target="_blank">See pictures on how to make crackers/crispbread</a>. Move to a greased oven tray and cut into little squares when the dough is on the tray. Spray some water on the little pieces and sprinkle over almond flour or sliced almonds. Bake for 10 minutes, and let cool on a rack.

_Can&#8217;t wait for my next wine and cheese night with these homemade crunchy crackers!_

If they have enough color after 10 minutes, but aren’t crispy enough, first bake out all the crackers, then return to the oven and dry them at 170°F for as long as it takes (although keep an eye on them so they don’t burn).

Serve with some delicious cheese!
