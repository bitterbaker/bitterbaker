Ready for some crunchy deliciousness to go with your next barbecue? These grissinis are amazing. I resisted my natural instinct to pair rosemary with garlic and went for the sweet onion instead.

I&#8217;m so, so glad I did. Turns out you should never underestimate the sweet onion.

Paired with crushed black pepper it&#8217;s a dangerous combination. I can already picture them on the barbecue buffet, rolled up in proscioutto, quickly disappearing amongst a gang of crazy munchers.

_How many synonyms for crunchy can you come up with? No googling._ 

They kind of have a roasted onion taste to them. Or no, I know! They remind me of the giant fried <a href="http://www.outback.com/menu/bloomin-onion.aspx" target="_blank">Bloomin Onion</a> that they serve at Outback Steakhouse. Mm, can you imagine? They&#8217;re that good. But instead of being greasy and moist like the monster onion, they&#8217;re crunchy and crispy. Not too bad of a trade-off, right?

_Fresh rosemary never fails you._ 

**Rosemary, sweet onion & black pepper grissinis**

_Total time: 24 hours to let the pre-dough get active. Then another 5-6 hours to roll out the dough and baking the grissinis. Makes around 80 thin grissinis._

**Ingredients**
  
_Day 1_

  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">115 g (4 oz) white starter</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">400 g (14 oz, not fluid!) filtered water</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">200 g (7 oz) bread flour</span>

_Day 2_

  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 tbsp sea salt</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 tbsp honey</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">600 g (21.2 oz) bread flour</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">4 stems fresh rosemary</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 large sweet onion</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1/2 cup olive oil</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 tsp black pepper</span>

**Toppings**
  
<span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">sea salt</span>
  
<span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">black pepper</span>

**Instructions**
  
Make the pre-dough by mixing starter, water and bread flour in a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit in room temperature for 24 hours until the <a title="What an active pre-dough looks like" href="http://bitterbaker.com/what-an-active-pre-dough-looks-like/" target="_blank">pre-dough is active, looking nice and bubbly</a>. Prepare the flavoring by mixing rosemary, black pepper, sweet onion and olive oil in a food processor. Cover and let marinade until the pre-dough is active.

Add sea salt, honey, the onion/rosemary/olive oil/black pepper mix, and bread flour to the pre-dough. Let the dough rest 2-3 hours. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Divide the dough into little pieces. Roll out each piece so that it measures about 10 inches long, and ¼ of an inch wide. Put the grissinis on greased oven trays, brush them with water and sprinkle on your toppings. Bake in the oven for a total 25-30 minutes (turn the grissinis after 15 minutes to get an even golden brown color).

If the grissinis still aren&#8217;t crispy, but have enough color, you can bake them at 170°F until they are (although take the grissinis out of the oven and let the oven cool off entirely before you &#8220;dry&#8221; your grissinis. If you leave them in there while the oven&#8217;s temperature is going from 350°F to 170°F, they will probably burn). It can take anything from 30 minutes up to 1 hour.

Let cool on a rack.

_Sea salt and black pepper on top is the perfect finish!_
