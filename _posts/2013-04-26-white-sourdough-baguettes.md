I made baguettes. Again. I can&#8217;t stop myself, it&#8217;s like an addiction. After making my last <a title="Baguettes with air" href="/baguettes-with-air/" target="_blank">baguettes with giant holes</a>, it&#8217;s gotten even worse. I wanted to recreate those very same baguettes, but with sourdough. The same amount of air, the same lightness, the same crust. Wouldn&#8217;t that be amazing?

Sourdough baguettes take a little more work than baguettes made with yeast, but they&#8217;re definitely worth it. These don&#8217;t quite have as much air as the ones made with yeast, but definitely enough to satisfy me!

_Sourdough o__r not sourdough, that is the question._

**White sourdough baguettes**
  
_Total time: 1 hour to make the dough. Then 3-4 days to let the dough ferment in your fridge. Lastly 3-4 hours to let the dough rise in room temperature and baking the baguettes. Makes 4 sourdough baguettes._ 

**Ingredients**
  
• 100 g (3.5 oz) white starter
  
• 425 g (15 oz, not fluid!) filtered water
  
• ¾ tbsp sea salt
  
• 567 g (20 oz) bread flour
  
• 1 tbsp olive oil

**Toppings**
  
bread flour

**Instructions**
  
Mix starter, water, sea salt and bread flour in a bowl. Let the dough rest 5 minutes, then mix in the olive oil and work the dough for about 1 minute. Put the dough in a new, lightly oiled bowl and let it rest 10 minutes. Take out the dough on a lightly oiled surface. Give it one stretch and fold treatment (fold the top of the dough over the bottom, the bottom over the top, left over right, right over left). Put the dough back in the bowl, seamside down. Let it rest 10 minutes and then repeat the process three times, for a total of four stretch and fold treatments. Let the dough rest 10 minutes in between each treatment. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough sit in room temperature for about 12 hours until it has started to show yeast activity. Then put the bowl in the fridge and let the dough ferment for 3-4 days.

_Oops. The shaping is a little off, but the taste is superb._

Take out the bowl from the fridge and leave it in room temperature for 3 hours. You can leave the plastic wrap on. Tip out the dough carefully on a lightly oiled surface. Cut it in four pieces. Carefully stretch them into rectangles, then fold them in thirds (like I did here with the dough for the croissants). Place them on a lightly oiled parchment paper and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let rest 1 hour. Gently stretch and fold them again, and put the plastic wrap back on. Let rest 1 hour. Fold them in thirds a third time (put the plastic wrap back on), turn on the oven (to 500°F) and let them rest until the oven is warm.

Preheat the oven to 500 °F. Lightly dust the dough with some flour on the top side. Pick up one piece, and gently drag it out to a long baguette while at the same time twisting it a few laps. Place the twisted baguettes on greased oven trays. Put the bread in the oven and throw in ½ cup of water on the bottom. Quickly shut the oven so the steam doesn’t escape. Bake for 10 minutes. Lower the temperature to 450°F and bake another 10-15 minutes, until the baguettes are golden brown.

_Yup. They were worth all the waiting._
