  * 2 cups of warm water
  * 1 tbsp active dry yeast
  * 1 tbsp sugar
  * 0.5 tbsp sea salt
  * 2/3 cup chopped sundried tomatoes in oil
  * 1 tbsp Italian seasoning
  * 630 g (22.2 oz) bread flour
  * 1 tbsp olive oil

**Toppings**

  * 1 large egg
  * 1 cup <a style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;" href="http://www.sargento.com/products/223/sargento-chef-blends-four-state-cheddar-shredded-cheese/" target="_blank">Shredded 4 State Cheddar Cheese</a>
  * shredded parmesan

**Instructions**
  
Activate the yeast in the warm water together with the sugar for a few minutes. Add sea salt, sundried tomatoes, italian seasoning and bread flour. Knead to a dough (should remain a little sticky, but not unmanageable). Let the dough rest in its bowl for five minutes, then mix in the olive oil. Let the dough rise until doubled, about 1 hour.

_Make this next time your having an Italian themed dinner._ 

Tip out the dough on a lightly floured working bench. Stretch it out a little and place the egg and the shredded cheese in the middle. Fold the sides over the cheese and egg, so they’re no longer visible. Take a dough cutter and start chopping the dough in little pieces. The egg and the cheese will make it into a gooey mass. When done, place the pieces in a greased 9” spring form pan. Let rise 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 350°F. Sprinkle some (or lots of) parmesan cheese on top of the monkey bread and bake for 1 hour.

Let cool in the spring form pan for about 10 minutes. Then take it out of the form and let cool on a rack.

_Looks kind of cool, cutting it like a cake, don&#8217;t you think? But it&#8217;s not sweet, I promise._
