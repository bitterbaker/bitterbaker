Third time&#8217;s the charm, right? This time I spiced up the grissinis with sundried tomates, garlic and chili flakes. You can imagine that by now, I&#8217;m basically drowning in an ocean of grissinis. Luckily, I&#8217;ll get some help this weekend eating them all.

_The sundried tomatoes give the grissinis a nice, warmer color._

**Chili, garlic and tomato grissini**

_Duration: 24 hours for pre-dough to get active. Then another 5-6 hours to let the dough rise and making the grissinis.
  
Makes about 100 thin grissinis._

**Ingredients**
  
_Day 1_

  * 115 g (4 oz) white starter
  * 400 g (14 oz, not fluid!) filtered water
  * 200 g (7 oz) bread flour

  * 10 garlic cloves
  * ½ cup olive oil
  * 10 sundried tomato halves
  * 0.5 tbsp chili flakes

_Day 2_

  * 0.5 tbsp sea salt
  * 1 tbsp honey
  * 450 g (15.9 oz) bread flour

**Toppings**
  
sea salt
  
sesame seeds
  
fennel seeds

**Directions**
  
Press the garlic cloves and mince the sundried tomatoes. Put the olive oil, garlic, tomatoes and chili flakes in a mixer and mix to a fairly smooth paste. Cover and let sit for 24 hours. Make the pre-dough by mixing white starter, water and bread flour. Wrap the bowl with plastic wrap and let sit for 24 hours until the <a title="What an active pre-dough looks like" href="http://bitterbaker.com/what-an-active-pre-dough-looks-like/" target="_blank">pre-dough is active, looking nice and bubbly</a>.

Add sea salt, honey and bread flour. Let the dough rest 2-3 hours. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Divide the dough into little pieces. Roll out each piece so that it measures about 10 inches long, and ¼ of an inch wide. Put the grissinis on greased oven trays, brush them with water and sprinkle on your toppings. Bake in the oven for a total of ca. 20-25 minutes (turn the grissinis after 15 minutes to get an even golden brown color).

Let cool on a rack.

_Crush some fennel seeds in a mortar (<a title="Someone stole my mortar. What do I use instead?" href="http://bitterbaker.com/someone-stole-my-mortar-what-do-i-use-instead/" target="_blank">don&#8217;t have a mortar? use a garlic press instead</a>) and sprinkle on._
