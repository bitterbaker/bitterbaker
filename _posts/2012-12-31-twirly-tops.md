**Ingredients**

_Day 1_

  * 200 g rye (7 oz) sourdough starter
  * 600 g filtered water (21.2 oz, not fluid!)
  * 350 g white bread flour (12.3 oz)

_Day 2_

  * 2 tbsp honey
  * 0.5 tbsp sea salt
  * 500 g white bread flour (17.6 oz)

**Toppings**
  
olive oil
  
poppyseeds
  
sea salt

**Directions**
  
Mix rye sourdough starter, water and bread flour. Wrap bowl with cling wrap and let it sit in room temperature for 24 hours.

After 24 hours, the <a title="What an active pre-dough looks like" href="http://bitterbaker.com/what-an-active-pre-dough-looks-like/" target="_blank">pre-dough should be active and look all bubbly</a>. Add sea salt, honey and bread flour. Knead the dough until it’s nice and firm and does not stick.

<a title="How to roll a twirly top" href="/how-to-roll-a-twirly-top/" target="_blank">See pictures here of how to roll a twirly top</a>. I&#8217;ll try to explain it with words here too. With a baking roller, roll the dough into a large, rectangular shape (should be quite thin). Spread out a thin layer of olive oil over the entire square, and pour some poppyseeds over the dough. Grab a hold of the long, top side of the rectangular and fold it over the bottom half of the rectangular. I usually use my baking roller once again to make the dough a little flatter. Thereafter, cut the dough into 0.5 inch wide strips (my dough was good for 36 rolls). Hold the strip with your left hand, grab it with your right and roll the strip around your left thumb, index finger and middle finger two or three laps, creating a little ball. Wrap the end of the strip sideways, first over the ball in the middle (so that the strip crosses the former laps), then tuck the very last bit under the muffin. Place the buns on oven trays and let rise for 2 hours.

Put a casserole dish filled with water in the oven, on the bottom rack. Preheat oven to 460° F. Spread some olive oil and sea salt on each bun. Bake the buns about 10-15 minutes until golden brown. Knock on bottom to make sure they&#8217;re done (should sound hollow).

_Just two more hours, then into the oven they go._
