I&#8217;m like completely obsessed with making my own granola. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s such a bad thing. At least I hope it&#8217;s not. I mean, you could be obsessed with way worse things. Although I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s healthy to worry about whether or not it was a mistake to opt for the raisins instead of the dried apricots.

_Fruit, cottage cheese and granola._ 

Okay, fine. I&#8217;m not that obsessed. Plus, I can always make new batches of granola. My biggest problem is remembering all the combinations I think of. Although that&#8217;s not a very big problem. Anyhow. This granola! You&#8217;ll love it. It&#8217;s just as healthy as the other granola recipes I have ([Gingerbread granola](/healthy-gingerbread-granola/ "Healthy gingerbread granola") and Cinnamon pumpkin granola). But, but, but. It&#8217;s even a tiny bit healthier. I didn&#8217;t add any honey this time (you get enough natural sweetness from the raisins), and I took away half of the canola oil (why not? nuts have enough oil in them, I thought). And it&#8217;s SO good! The nuts roast perfectly fine in the oven without the extra oil, the amazing flavors still come out. I actually prefer it this way, with less canola oil. The granola gets a brighter color, and it just feels more natural in a way (not saying that canola oil isn&#8217;t natural, but you know what I mean &#8211; it feels more RAW, or whatever).

_Yeah&#8230; Not sure about a whole bowl full of granola for breakfast. That&#8217;s too much chewing for me._

My new thing is to serve it with cottage cheese and fruit. Perfect for breakfast, lunch, snack or just about anytime, really.

_Bananas!_

**Instructions**
  
Preheat the oven to 390°F. Mix all the dry ingredients except for the shredded coconut in a bowl. Add water and canola oil and mix well. Spread out an even layer of granola on one or two oven trays (I used two since I can fit two trays in my oven). Roast in the oven for 25 minutes. Stir after every ten minutes, and keep an eye on the granola when five minutes is left, you don’t want it to burn!

Let cool and then mix in the shredded coconut. Serve with fruit and yoghurt, cottage cheese and yoghurt, or use it to make delicious granola bars!
