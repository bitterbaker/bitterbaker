Before we start talking about the bread , I feel like I need to explain what _filmjölk_ is. The simple explanation is that it&#8217;s the Swedish equivalent of American buttermilk. Although I have to say, that in their purest forms, they&#8217;re very different.

I don&#8217;t know anyone here that would have buttermilk with cereal for breakfast (and let the record show, neither would I). In Sweden, the buttermilk is somewhat creamier, with a smoother flavor – which makes it perfect for having with cereal (but yes, we do eat milk and cereal over there, too). My taste buds seem to think that American buttermilk is too loose, and too sour, for breakfast purposes..

_Add your favorite nuts and seeds to the bread._ 

Not to say that buttermilk can&#8217;t be used for anything! We can still make a fantastic filmjölkslimpa with the buttermilk we have here. This loaf comes in many flavor combinations. Just like crispbread, you can basically put whatever you want in it. The basic concept remains the same. And oh boy, filmjölkslimpa has to be one the greatest inventions of all times. No yeast needed. No kneading needed. Only mixing ingredients, baking the loaf, and it&#8217;s done.

Normally, I would put lingonberry sauce in my bread, but since cranberry sauce is more common over here, that makes an excellent substitution. I refuse to make an extra trip to IKEA only because I need lingonberry sauce. I&#8217;m not _that_ fanatic, believe it or not.

_Paired with yoghurt, fruit and granola – it makes the perfect breakfast._

_Total time: 5 minutes to mix ingredients. Then 1 hour and 45 minutes to bake the loaf. Makes 1 loaf._ 

**Ingredients**

  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">2 cups buttermilk</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 can whole berry cranberry sauce (14 oz, or 397 g)</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">½ cup chopped hazelnuts</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">½ cup sunflower seeds</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">½ cup pumpkin seeds</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 cup flaxseeds</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 cup oat bran</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1.5 tsp baking soda</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1.5 tsp baking powder</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 tsp sea salt</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 cup wheat germ</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">2.5 cups whole wheat flour</span>

**Instructions**
  
Preheat the oven to 390°F. Mix the buttermilk with the cranberry sauce in one bowl. In another bowl, mix all the dry ingredients. Stir in the dry ingredients in the buttermilk/cranberry sauce mix. Grease a loaf pan and pour the batter/dough in it (it will be kind of loose!). Bake the loaf for 1 hour and 45 minutes, until it has reached an inner temperature of 97°C, or 206.6°F.

Take the loaf out of the pan and let cool on a rack. Let it cool thoroughly to prevent the inside from being gooey when you cut it.

Enjoy!
