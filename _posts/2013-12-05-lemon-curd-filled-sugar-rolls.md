There is something so special about biting into a sweet roll only to discover an even sweeter surprise hidden in the middle. I love it even if itâ€™s not a surprise, just the anticipation that something yummier is hidden inside just makes everything about the roll awesome.

_Brush the rolls with melted butter to get the sugar to stick._

Iâ€™ve been wanting to make these for a while now. I remember making the same kind of rolls, although filled with vanilla custard, and it really was my favorite roll when I was little. I even liked them better than cinnamon rolls. Which says a lot for a kid from Sweden. Just saying.

_Anyone else a lemon curd fan?_

Taste-tester # 2 (husband) was amazed with the rolls as well. Although if he could have chosen, he would rather have eaten just a big bowl of lemon curd on its own.

**Lemon curd filled sugar rolls**
  
_Time: 2-3 hours. Makes 24 rolls._

**Ingredients**

  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">0,5 l milk (17.6 oz, not fluid! or slightly more than 2 cups)</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">2 tsp active dry yeast</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1,5 stick butter (170 g)</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">a pinch of salt</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Â½ cup sugar</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 tsp ground cardamom</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 egg</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">800-850 g (28.2-30 oz) all-purpose flour, take as much as you need â€“ you donâ€™t want a sticky dough.</span>

**Lemon curd ingredients**

  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">4 egg yolks</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">pinch of salt</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Â½ cup sugar (or more if you would like it sweeter, I like mine pretty sour)</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Â½ cup lemon juice</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">zest from 2 lemons</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">6 tbsp unsalted butter</span>

**Toppings**
  
melted butter
  
sugar

_Hmm, the picture really doesn&#8217;t make the roll justice â€“ they are way juicier than it looks. ðŸ™‚_

**Instructions**
  
Heat up the milk to about 110-115 Â°F. Dissolve the active dry yeast in the milk and let it sit for a few minutes. Melt the butter and mix in with the milk. Add a pinch of salt, sugar, cardamom, egg and flour. Mix to a dough. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and let rise until double the size, about 1 hour.

<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Meanwhile make the lemon curd. Prepare a water bath by heating up a pot of water. Place a metal bowl on top and mix all the ingredients in it except for butter. Continually whip the lemon curd by hand over the water bath until it gets thick, about 10-15 minutes. When done, take the metal bowl off the water bath to the side and mix in the butter, 1 tbsp at a time. Press the lemon curd through a strainer to get rid of the zest. Set aside and let cool.</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Take the dough and divide it in 24 pieces. Roll each piece into a round ball. Flatten the ball out with your fingers and place a teaspoon full of lemon curd in the middle. Fold up the sides and pinch them together, so that no lemon curd can leak out. Flip upside down and place in baking cups, seamside down. Let the rolls rise for about 30 minutes to 1 hr, until almost double in size.</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Bake at 440Â°F for about 10-13 minutes, until golden brown. Let cool slightly before you brush them with melted butter and dip them in regular sugar.</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Enjoy!</span>
