My friend wanted to find a healthy whole wheat roll recipe. You know, the kind of roll which gives you a great start in the morning and enough energy until lunch (or whenever your next meal is). So here goes. I got the idea of toasting the fennel seeds from the <a title="Gnom-gnom blog" href="http://www.gnom-gnom.com/olive-bread-recipe/" target="_blank">#gnom-gnom blog</a>. I like it.

_Mmm&#8230; breakfast._

**Nutty whole wheat rolls**

_Duration:_ _24 hours to get the pre-dough active. Then another 3 hours to let the dough rise and bake the rolls._
  
 _Makes 20 rolls._

**Ingredients**
  
_Day 1_

  * 140 g rye starter (4.9 oz)
  * 500 g filtered water (17.6 oz, not fluid!)
  * 300 g bread flour (10.6 oz)

_Day 2_

  * 80 g (2.8 oz) chopped walnuts
  * 80 g (2.8 oz) sunflower seeds
  * 1 tbsp sea salt
  * 2 tbsp honey
  * ¾ tbsp anise seeds
  * 1 tbsp fennel seeds
  * 100 g (3.5 oz) whole wheat graham flour
  * 100 g (3.5 oz) light rye flour
  * 20 g (0.7 oz) wheat bran
  * 150 g (5.3 oz) whole wheat flour
  * 100 g (3.5 oz) bread flour

**Toppings**
  
oats
  
poppy seeds

**Directions**
  
Mix rye starter, water and bread flour in a bowl. Wrap with cling wrap and let sit for 24 hours, until the [pre-dough is active, looking nice and bubbly](http://bitterbaker.com/what-an-active-pre-dough-looks-like/ "What an active pre-dough looks like"). Toast the walnuts, sunflower seeds, anise seeds and fennel seeds in the oven (on broil for example). Mix in the nuts and seeds along with honey and sea salt. Add the different kinds of flours and knead to a firm dough. Shape into 20 rolls and roll in your choice of toppings. Put the rolls on an oven tray and let rise for 2 hours, or until they have almost doubled in size.

Put in a casserole dish with water on the lower rack and preheat the oven to 460°F. Cut a stroke in each bun, then bake them for about 10 minutes at 460°F. Lower the heat to 390°F and continue baking for about 15 minutes until they are done (see <a href="http://bitterbaker.com/?p=198" target="_blank">how to know when your bread is done</a>).
