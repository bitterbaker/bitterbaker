Is it misleading to call something that&#8217;s not sweet &#8220;cakes&#8221;? In case it is, I&#8217;m sorry. These bread cakes aren&#8217;t very sweet. Not at all actually (they do have honey in them though). But they&#8217;re tasty. Especially if you&#8217;re into the whole caraway/fennel/anise thing. Which I am.

I suppose you could make them sweet if you wanted to. Not by adding sugar (technically you _could_ do that too, I suppose), but by toasting them and serving them with melted butter and sweet marmelade on top.. I think I could slip down one of those. Maybe two even.

_Steaming hot out of the oven with some melted butter. Am I the only one in heaven?_

It&#8217;s funny how you can&#8217;t stop baking with caraway, fennel and anise once you&#8217;ve started. Even though I like white bread, whole wheat bread with seeds, nuts and spices are just so much more interesting to me. It&#8217;s not even only the flavors, but the whole baking process. How fun is it to make a dough out of nothing but white flour? Not very fun. Right? Much more fun to mix and match.

_The baking cups are only there for decoration. Didn&#8217;t actually bake the cakes in them. But I know you knew that already. So we&#8217;re all good. No confusion._ 

**Caraway, fennel and anise whole wheat cakes**
  
_Total time: 20 hours to let the pre-dough get active. Then another 6 hours to let the dough rise and baking the flat cakes. Makes 16 whole wheat bread cakes._ 

**Ingredients**
  
_Day 1_

  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">105 g (3.7 oz) white starter</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">335 g (11.8 oz, not fluid!) filtered water</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">204 g (7.2 oz) bread flour</span>

_Day 2_

  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 tbsp sea salt</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">2 tbsp honey</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 cup wheat germ</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">½ cup flaxseeds</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">½ tbsp anise seeds</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">½ tbsp caraway seeds</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">½ tbsp fennel seeds</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">150 g (5.3 oz) whole wheat flour</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">100 g (3.5 oz) bread flour</span>

**Toppings**
  
wheat germ

**Instructions**
  
Mix starter, water and bread flour in a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit in room temperature for 20 hours until the pre-dough is <a title="What an active pre-dough looks like" href="/what-an-active-pre-dough-looks-like/" target="_blank">active and bubbly</a>.

Add sea salt, honey, wheat germ, flaxseeds, anise, caraway, fennel and flour to the starter mix. Knead to a firm dough and let rise in the bowl for 2-3 hours covered with a kitchen towel. Take out the dough on a floured surface and divide it into 16 pieces. Flatten each piece into a thin pancake, ca. ½ inch thick. Dip the bottom in wheat germ and place on a greased oven tray. Let rise 2-3 hours, covered with a kitchen towel.

_(Pan)cake tower!_

Preheat the oven to 485°F. Punctuate the cakes with a fork and bake for 20-25 minutes until golden brown. The cakes should sound hollow when you knock on the bottom.

Let cool on a rack, covered with a kitchen towel to keep them soft.
