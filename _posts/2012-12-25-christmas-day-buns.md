<p style="text-align: left;">
  The sourdough twirly tops seemed to pass the test of the family jury (an honest crowd). They actually turned out so well, I thought I would make them again, as we&#8217;re off to another family gathering today.<br /> Everybody usually bring food to these gatherings, and ever since they learned I know how to make bread, that is what ended up on my table. I always try not to go bananas when making bread for a large crowd, you want everyone to like it, no matter if they&#8217;re five or seventy years old.

Since my husband’s family is a giant one (compared to mine; I only have two cousins) we need a lot of bread. So besides the sourdough muffin tops, normal buns are up. Just to make it a little bit more interesting, I added some flaxseeds.

_I will definitely make these buns again._ 

**Flaxseed buns**

_Duration: 24 hours for pre-dough to get active. Then 3 hours to let the dough rise and baking the buns.
  
Makes 16 buns._

**Ingredients**
  
_Day 1_

  * 195 g white (6.9 oz) sourdough starter
  * 500 g filtered water (17.6 oz, not fluid!)
  * 340 g of bread flour (12 oz)

_Day 2_

  * 518 g (18.3 oz) bread flour
  * 2/3 cup flaxseeds
  * 1 tbsp sea salt
  * 2 tbsp honey

**Toppings**
  
sea salt
  
canola oil

**Directions**
  
Mix starter, water and bread flour in a bowl. Wrap the bowl with cling wrap and let sit in room temperature for 24 hours, <a title="What an active pre-dough looks like" href="/what-an-active-pre-dough-looks-like/" target="_blank">until the pre-dough is active, looking bubbly</a>. Add sea salt, honey and flaxseeds. Mix in bread flour until it starts to feel like a dough. Take up the dough on your working bench and knead it further. Divide the dough into 16 pieces. Roll little buns and place on a tray. Let rise for 2 hours.

Put in a casserole dish with half an inch of water in the oven. Preheat it to 460°F and bake the buns for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. The buns should sound hollow when knocking on the bottom.
