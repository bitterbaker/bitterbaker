Didn&#8217;t I say something about starting a crispbread fad before? I think I did. I&#8217;m pretty sure. Well, here we go again. Another crispbread recipe. You just gotta love them – the variations are endless. This one has a bunch of dark rye flour in it, giving it a distinct rye taste. If you&#8217;ve ever heard of <a href="http://www.finncrisp.com/crispbreads/thin-crisps/finn-crisp-original/" target="_blank">FINN Crisp</a> – that is what this crispbread reminds me of (and yes, that&#8217;s a good thing).

_One of the best things is when food reminds you of home. So yeah, I was pretty happy when I realized that the cripsbread reminded me of <a href="http://www.finncrisp.com/crispbreads/thin-crisps/finn-crisp-original/" target="_blank">FINN Crisp</a>._ 

Just like the other crispbreads that I&#8217;ve made (<a title="Sourdough crispbread" href="/sourdough-crispbread/" target="_blank">Sourdough crispbread</a>, <a title="Flaxseed crisps" href="/valentines-day-sourdough-crisps/" target="_blank">Flaxseed crisps</a> and <a title="Healthy quinoa and caraway sourdough crispbread" href="/healthy-quinoa-and-caraway-sourdough-crisp-bread/" target="_blank">Quinoa and caraway sourdough crispbread</a>) – this kind too is crunchy and delicious. And like with the other recipes, feel free to substitute any of the ingredients. Take these recipes and make your own version (of course you&#8217;re very welcome to follow the recipe, too, if you want), see them as a source of inspiration.

_Don&#8217;t like pumpkin seeds? Feel free to swap them for something else._ 

**Rye crispbread with pumpkin seeds, flaxseed and anise**
  
_Total time: 12 hours to let the pre-dough get active. Then another 5-6 hours to let the dough rise, and bake the crispbread. Makes a lot._ 

**Ingredients**
  
_Day 1_

  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">100 g (3.5 oz) rye starter</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">309 g (10.9 oz, not fluid!) filtered water</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">309 g (10.9 oz) dark rye flour</span>

_Soaker:_

  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">½ cup pumpkin seeds</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">½ cup flaxseed meal</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">½ oat bran</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">½ cup wheat germ</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">0.5 tbsp anise seeds</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 tbsp sea salt</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 cup boiling water</span>

_Day 2_

  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 cup wheat bran</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">2 tbsp honey</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">300 g (10.6 pz) whole wheat flour</span>

**Toppings**
  
sunflower seeds
  
pumpkin seeds
  
flaxseeds
  
poppy seeds
  
sea salt

**Instructions**
  
Mix starter, water and dark rye flour in a bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let sit in room temperature for 12 hours. Make the soaker by mixing all dry ingredients in a bowl. Boil the water and mix in with the dry ingredients. Stir well and cover the bowl wit plastic wrap. Let rest in room temperature for 12 hours.

_As always, the toppings are just suggestions – you can top your crispbreads with whatever you want. Or nothing if that&#8217;s your style._

After 12 hours, mix the sourdough mix with the soaker. Add 1 cup of wheat bran, honey and finally the whole wheat flour. Knead to a firm dough. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and let rise for 3 hours.

Preheat the oven to 480°F. Cut the dough into little pieces. Roll out one pieces to thin (super thin!) pancake, and put the whole thing on an oven tray. Cut it into pieces with something sharp, like a pizza slicer. Brush the pieces with water and sprinkle on your choice of toppings (<a title="How to make crispbread" href="/how-to-make-crispbread/" target="_blank">see pictures of how to make crisp bread</a>). Bake for 5-8 minutes (depending on how thick your crispbreads are, it could take up to 12-15 minutes).

If the crispbread has enough color, but isn’t quite as crispy as you would like, take them out of the oven and bake the rest of the crispbread. When you’re done, lower the temperature to 170°F and dry the crispbread in the oven until they&#8217;re crispy enough.
