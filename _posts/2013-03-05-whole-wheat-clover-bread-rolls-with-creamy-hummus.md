Don&#8217;t you just love nice surprises? When I started making these clover bread rolls, I had no idea how they would turn out. I thought they might be pretty good. Edible, at least. But oh my goodness. They are probably the most perfect little whole wheat rolls I have ever made. They are SO good. Just the perfect amount of whole wheat flour, with lots of fluffy, moist bread inside and a semi-thick crust that is crunchy and chewy at the same time.

Then (yeah, I didn&#8217;t stop at the first bite), I took out the hummus we made last night. And oh my goodness (again). I think these rolls were made to go with hummus. It was awesome. And the hummus was really creamy and slightly, slightly spicy, just the way I want it. I&#8217;ll post that recipe here too, you&#8217;ll love it!

_You know I love my sea salt. And my poppy seeds. I can&#8217;t help it. They are just the perfect toppings for every kind of bread._ 

<strong style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Whole wheat clover bread rolls</strong>

_Total time: 12 hours to let the pre-dough get active. Then another 6 hours to let the dough rise and baking the buns. Makes 9 clover bread rolls. _

**Ingredients**
  
_Day 1_

  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">100 g (3.5 oz) rye starter</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">220 g (7.8 oz, not fluid!) filtered water</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">124 g (4.4 oz) whole wheat flour</span>

 _Day 2_

  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">0.5 tbsp sea salt</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 tbsp molasses</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">55 g (1.9 oz) light rye flour</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">178 g (6.3 oz) bread flour</span>

**Toppings**
  
poppy seeds
  
sea salt

**Instructions**
  
Mix rye starter, water and whole wheat flour in a bowl. Wrap with plastic wrap and let rest in room temperature until the pre-dough is active, <a title="What an active pre-dough looks like" href="/what-an-active-pre-dough-looks-like/" target="_blank">looking nice and bubbly</a>. Add sea salt, molasses, light rye flour and bread flour. Let the dough rest in the bowl in room temperature 2-3 hours.

Take out the dough on a floured working bench. Divide it in 9 pieces. Cut each piece in three smaller pieces. Grease a muffin form pan. Roll the smaller pieces into little round balls and place three small pieces in each muffin form. Cover with a kitchen towel and let rise in room temperature about 2 hours, until they have doubled in size.

_Put three small balls in each muffin form. Cover with a kitchen towel and let rise. _

Put a casserole dish full of water on the lower rack of the oven and preheat it to 500°F. Brush the buns with water and sprinkle sea salt and poppy seeds on top. Put the buns in the oven and turn down the temperature to 460°F. Bake for 15-20 minutes, until they are golden brown and sound hollow when you knock on the bottom of the bun. Let cool on a rack.
