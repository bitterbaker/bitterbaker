I borrowed this really cool cookbook from my friend called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Make-Bread-Buy-Butter-Shouldnt/dp/1451605870/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0" target="_blank">Make the Bread, Buy the Butter</a>. If you ever wondered if homemade mayonnaise is better than store-bought – and/or if it&#8217;s cheaper – you&#8217;ll need this book. It tells you all that, and more.

English muffins have been on my list of things to bake a long time now. So when I found the recipe for these (seriously my favorite bread to toast), I just had to make it right away. They kind of look like real English muffins, too, don&#8217;t they? If there&#8217;s one thing I like, it&#8217;s when recipes turns out the way I expect them to.

_Make your own English muffins. Definitely better than the store-bought kind._ 

The recipe was a piece of cake to follow, too. So make these next time you&#8217;re making eggs benedict. I myself have serious plans to try this version of the classic: <a href="http://domesticfits.com/2013/04/01/blt-eggs-benedict-with-avocado-hollandaise/" target="_blank">BLT Eggs Benedict with Avocado Hollandaise</a>.

Oh, oh, oh!! Almost forgot. Guess who&#8217;s participating in <a href="http://www.seattleglobalist.com/" target="_blank">The Seattle Globalist</a>&#8216;s all-day LIVE webcast for <a href="http://www.seattlefoundation.org/npos/Pages/TheCommonLanguageProject.aspx?bv=nposearch" target="_blank">GiveBig</a>&#8216;s day of fundraising? Yes, me! I&#8217;m so excited. Won&#8217;t tell you too much, but you&#8217;ll see 15 minutes of me and a recipe that has yet to be published on bitter baker. Make sure to save the date for May 15th, which is when all the fun will be going down.

_Serve with soft boiled eggs, or make a real eggs benedict if you have time._

**Instructions**
  
Mix warm water, yeast, sugar, sea salt and 2 cups of flour in a bowl. Add the egg, butter and milk. Add the remaining 2 cups of flour and knead until a smooth dough. Add extra flour if you need it, but not too much, you still want a soft and moist dough.

Oil another bowl and place the dough in there. Cover with a damp kitchen towel and let rise until doubled, about 2 hours.

Sprinkle a work surface with cornmeal. Place the dough on the cornmeal and sprinkle the top with more cornmeal. Roll the dough into a 9 “x 15” rectangle, about ½ inch thick. Don’t stretch the dough. Cut out the muffins (use a 3-inch biscuit cutter if you have one, otherwise a glass in similar size). Reroll the scraps and cut out the rest of the muffins.

Heat a cast-iron skillet until very hot.

Place as many muffins in the hot pan as will fit without crowding. Immediately turn down the heat to medium so the muffins cook through without burning – 10-15 minutes per side. They should be a light hazelnut brown.

Let the muffins cool on a rack. Split with a fork before toasting. Store in a bag at room temperature for up to a week, or freeze them directly.
