**Instructions**
  
Mix starter, water and bread flour in a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest in room temperature for 12 horus until the pre-dough is active and bubbly.

_Sourdough yeeaah!_

Divide the dough in four pieces. Divide each fourth in another three pieces. Roll out each piece to a 15 inch long string. Use three strings for each braid (sorry I forgot to take pictures!). Put the braids on greased oven trays and let rise for about 2-3 hours, covered by a kitchen towel. Preheat the oven to 500°F.

_Braiding really isn&#8217;t as hard as it looks, and even though they might not turn out perfect, they&#8217;ll turn out pretty._ 

Brush some water on the braids and sprinkle sesame and poppy seeds on top. Spray some water on the bottom of the oven and bake the braids for about 10 minutes at 500°F. Lower the temperature to 390°F and bake another 10-15 minutes until they are golden brown and sound hollow when you knock on the bottom.

Let cool on a rack.
