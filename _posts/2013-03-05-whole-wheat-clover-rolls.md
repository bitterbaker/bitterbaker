**Toppings**
  
poppy seeds
  
sea salt

**Instructions**
  
Mix rye starter, water and whole wheat flour in a bowl. Wrap with plastic wrap and let rest in room temperature until the pre-dough is active, <a title="What an active pre-dough looks like" href="/what-an-active-pre-dough-looks-like/" target="_blank">looking nice and bubbly</a>. Add sea salt, molasses, light rye flour and bread flour. Let the dough rest in the bowl in room temperature 2-3 hours.

Take out the dough on a floured working bench. Divide it in 9 pieces. Cut each piece in three smaller pieces. Grease a muffin form pan. Roll the smaller pieces into little round balls and place three small pieces in each muffin form. Cover with a kitchen towel and let rise in room temperature about 2 hours, until they have doubled in size.

_Put three small balls in each muffin form. Cover with a kitchen towel and let rise. _

Put a casserole dish full of water on the lower rack of the oven and preheat it to 500°F. Brush the buns with water and sprinkle sea salt and poppy seeds on top. Put the buns in the oven and turn down the temperature to 460°F. Bake for 15-20 minutes, until they are golden brown and sound hollow when you knock on the bottom of the bun. Let cool on a rack.
