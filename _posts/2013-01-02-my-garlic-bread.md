**Ingredients**
  
_Day 1_

  * 200 g (7 oz) white sourdough starter
  * 525 g filtered water (18.5 oz, not fluid!)
  * 275 g bread flour (9.7 oz)

_Day 2_

  * 6-7 garlic cloves (don&#8217;t be afraid to double or triple the amount if you love garlic)
  * 1/2 cup olive oil
  * 1 tbsp honey
  * 0.5 tbsp sea salt
  * 100 g semolina flour (3.5 oz)
  * 500 g bread flour (17.6 oz)

**Toppings**
  
olive oil
  
semolina flour

**Directions**
  
Mix starter, water and the first amount of bread flour in a bowl. Wrap it with cling wrap and let the it sit sin room temperature for 24 hours, until <a title="What an active pre-dough looks like" href="http://bitterbaker.com/what-an-active-pre-dough-looks-like/" target="_blank">the pre-dough is active, looking all bubbly</a>. Add minced garlic, olive oil, honey, sea salt, semolina flour and bread flour. Knead to a dough that is firm and slightly sticky. Divide into two parts. Out of the one half, shape nine little mini loaves and roll them in semolina flour before putting them on a tray (or in a special mini loaf pan). Out of the other half, shape 2 round loaves and put them in soufflé-like dishes (it should fill up about two thirds of the dish).

Let rise for 2 hours. Put a casserole dish with water in the oven on the lower rack. Preheat oven to 460° F. Before putting the loaves in the oven, spread olive oil and semolina flour over them.

Bake the two larger loaves 15 minutes, then lower the temperature to 390°F and continue baking until they have an inner temperature of 207°F, approximately 25 minutes.
  
Bake the mini loaves for 10 minutes at 460°F, then lower the temperature to 390°F and bake another 10-15 minutes until they are golden brown, and have reached an inner temperature of 207°F.
