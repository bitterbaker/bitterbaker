Do I even dare say that these were supposed to be gooey chocolate brownies? Well, that was a failure. How was I supposed to know that an extra egg equals a more dry cake?

Anyhow. The chocolate cake tasted really good, it was just that tiny detail that it wasn&#8217;t gooey enough to be brownie material. So I cut the cake into little pieces and made some mocha frosting and spread it on top. Turned out my failure wasn&#8217;t so useless after all!

The frosting literally melts in your mouth as you bite into the chocolate cake, and if you love the combination of chocolate and coffee, these love munchies will definitely be your new, sweet favorite.

Beat the eggs and the sugar until the batter is light and fluffy. Melt the butter and mix it with the canola oil. Sift the cocoa powder through and mix it with the flour. Add butter, canola oil and vanilla extract to the egg/sugar batter. Then, add the cocoa/flour mix.

Grease a 9” spring form with butter and powder it with cocoa powder. Pour the batter in it and bake in the oven at 350°F for 20 minutes. Let it cool on the counter and then cut the cake into little pieces.

Make the frosting by melting the butter. Add powdered sugar, cocoa powder, instant coffee and water and mix it together with an electric beater. Spread the frosting on top of the love munchies and sprinkle some shredded coconut on top.

Enjoy!
