These whole wheat sourdough braids are perfect if you&#8217;re looking for an easy way to get a quick sourdough baguette-like type of bread. Don&#8217;t need to wait for days for the dough to ferment in the fridge, and you don&#8217;t need to stretch and fold the dough ten times. You just have to do some braiding. We all remember how to do that, right?

_Oo, what do you see? Sesame seeds, mmm._ 

Honestly, braiding strings of dough can be somewhat confusing. I always mix up which one is supposed to go over the other, and which one goes in the middle. Even so, they still manage to look pretty decent. What I want to say is – it&#8217;s okay if they look like someone ran over them with a train when you&#8217;re done braiding. Once they get into the oven, all those little wrinkles will straighten out.

_Braiding really isn&#8217;t as hard as it looks, and even though they might not turn out perfect, they&#8217;ll turn out pretty._ 

Sometimes it surprises me which breads get that tangy sourdough taste. Like this one. It&#8217;s just so .. so.. sourdough-y. Just the taste, that is. Obviously it&#8217;s not doughy. Perfect sandwich bread.

**Whole wheat sourdough braids**

_Total time: 12 hours to let the pre-dough get active. Then another 6 hours to let the dough rise and baking the braids. Makes 4 sourdough baguette braids._ 

**Ingredients**
  
_Day 1_

  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">83 g (2.9 oz) white starter</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">468 g (16.5 oz, not fluid!) filtered water</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">493 g (17.4 oz) bread flour</span>

_Day 2_

  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 tbsp sea salt</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">2 tbsp honey</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">267 g (9.4 oz) whole wheat flour</span>

**Toppings**
  
sesame seeds
  
poppy seeds

**Instructions**
  
Mix starter, water and bread flour in a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest in room temperature for 12 horus until the pre-dough is active and bubbly.

Add sea salt, honey and whole wheat flour and knead to a dough. Let the dough rise in the bowl for about 3 hours, covered with a kitchen towel.

_Sourdough yeeaah!_

Divide the dough in four pieces. Divide each fourth in another three pieces. Roll out each piece to a 15 inch long string. Use three strings for each braid (sorry I forgot to take pictures!). Put the braids on greased oven trays and let rise for about 2-3 hours, covered by a kitchen towel. Preheat the oven to 500°F.

Brush some water on the braids and sprinkle sesame and poppy seeds on top. Spray some water on the bottom of the oven and bake the braids for about 10 minutes at 500°F. Lower the temperature to 390°F and bake another 10-15 minutes until they are golden brown and sound hollow when you knock on the bottom.

Let cool on a rack.
