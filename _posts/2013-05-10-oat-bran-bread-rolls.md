Sometimes you don&#8217;t realize how much you like something until you&#8217;ve been without it for a while. And while that holds true for many important things in life like love and friendship, it also holds true for smaller things, like food.

When I made these **oat bran bread rolls**, I hadn&#8217;t had sourdough bread in a while (I know, hard to believe, right?). Maybe that&#8217;s why I thought they were so delicious. Or maybe because they actually were.

_Breakfast anyone?_

All I know is that they&#8217;re like oatmeal in a little bun. Which is all I need. Sometimes months go by and all I want (and have) for breakfast is oatmeal with milk and ground cinnamon. Is there any other breakfast that is that good for you, and keeps you full until lunch? I don&#8217;t think so. The only exception would be these rolls. I&#8217;ll have to put them up to a test. Soon.

_If you don&#8217;t usually have bread for breakfast, I&#8217;d eat these squares with soup or a hearty chili._ 

**Oat bran bread rolls**
  
_Total time: 16-20 hours to get the pre-dough active. Then another 6-7 hours to let the dough rise and baking the oat bran bread. Makes 16 bread rolls._

  * 100 g (3.5 oz) white starter
  * 369 g (13 oz, not fluid!) filtered water
  * 300 g (10.6 oz) bread flour

_I usually put all my bread in the freezer right away. That way I can take out a roll or two and have them fresh whenever I want to._ 

**Instructions**
  
Mix starter, water and flour in a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit in room temperature for 16-20 hours, until the pre-dough is active and looking bubbly.

Add se salt, honey, light rye flour, oat bran and bread flour. Mix to a dough. Let the dough rest 5 minutes, then add the olive oil. Let rise in the bowl, covered with a kitchen towel for about 3 hours, until doubled.

Sprinkle oat bran on your working bench. Tip out the dough onto the oat bran and sprinkle more oat bran on top of the dough. Stretch into a square and cut the dough in 16 squares. Place them on a greased oven tray and let rise, covered with a kitchen towel, until doubled in size, 2-3 hours.

Preheat oven to 500°F. Spray some water on the bottom of the oven and bake the bread for 10 minutes. Lower the temperature to 450°F and bake another 10-15 minutes.

Let cool on a rack.
