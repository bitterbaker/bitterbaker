So after the whole 4th of July thing with too much sweets and other deliciousness, I&#8217;m kind of feeling it&#8217;s time for some healthy foods. I don&#8217;t know about you, but sugar and greasy foods make my stomach go bananas. So for the most part, I try to stick with things that make me feel good – nuts, fruits, vegetables, oat bran, flaxseeds&#8230; And even though bread has this notion around it to be unhealthy (which is sometimes can be), I believe there are ways to cut down on the white flour and make a perfectly healthy loaf.

_I&#8217;ve been doing the <a href="http://simplegreensmoothies.com/30-day-challenge" target="_blank">30-Day Green Smoothie Challenge</a> lately. So what you see in the glass back there is not purple poison, but the result of my own experiments, using leftovers from the challenge – blueberry smoothie with almond milk and cardamom. Not a bad combination folks, not bad._ 

After making the <a style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;" title="Dark rye bread with sunflower seeds" href="/dark-rye-bread-with-sunflower-seeds/" target="_blank">Dark rye bread with sunflower seeds</a> a while back from my German bread book, I wanted to make my own version. I simply love the taste of rye bread. And dark breads like these are incredibly grateful when making your own version. They almost always turns out good. All you have to do is go through your cupboards, pick out all your favorite goodies and mix them together. And baam – just like that – you got yourself one tasty, healthy dark rye loaf.

_The loaf will feel hard like a rock when you take it out of the oven, but don&#8217;t worry, the inside will be moist and delicious._ 

_Total time: 16-18 hours to get the pre-dough active. Then another 4 hours to let the dough rise and baking the bread. Makes 1 dark rye loaf. _

**Ingredients**

_Day 1_

  * 60 g (2.1 oz) rye starter
  * 252 g (8.9 oz, not fluid!) filtered water
  * 250 g (8.8 oz) dark rye flour

  * 1 tsp active dry yeast (+ 2 tbsp warm water)
  * 1 tbsp sea salt
  * 1 tbsp honey
  * 156 g (5.5 oz, not fluid!) filtered water
  * 65 g (2.3 oz) oat bran

_Breakfast? After school snack? After work meal? Light dinner? Your pick!_

**Instructions**
  
Mix rye starter, dark rye flour and water in a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in room temperature for about 16-18 hours.

Activate the yeast in 2 tbsp of warm water. Toast the walnuts, almonds, sunflower seeds and caraway seeds in the oven on broil, 6-7 minutes. Add all the ingredients to the pre-dough and work the dough with a mixer for 7-10 minutes, by hand at least 15-20 minutes. It&#8217;s going to be a very sticky dough, but that&#8217;s just the way you want it. Let the dough rest in the bowl, covered with a kitchen towel, for about 30 minutes. Knead the dough further about five minutes with the mixer (or 10 minutes by hand).

Grease a loaf pan and place the dough in it. The easiest way is to use a silicone scraper. Wet your hands with water and even out the top of the dough.

_Keep the loaf whole wrapped in a kitchen towel, or slice it and freeze the slices. That way you can have fresh bread every day._ 

Let the dough rise, covered with a kitchen towel, for 70 minutes. Preheat the oven to 500°F. Spray some water on the bottom of the oven and bake the bread on the second to lowest rack for 15 minutes. Open the oven to let some steam out. Lower the temperature to 390°F and continue baking for 45 minutes.

Take the dough out of the loaf pan and bake another 10 minutes, this time at 355°F.

Let cool on a rack. It will take some arm muscles to cut the bread.. The crust will be pretty hard, but the inside is moist and delicious! Top with your favorite veggies or a soft boiled egg, and feel healthy like never before.

_Protein bomb. Just the way I like it._
