I have literally spent hours trying to figure out the whole sourdough thing on the internet. What I&#8217;ve found is that there is probably nothing right or wrong, and your starter probably won&#8217;t die if you forget to feed it one day.

Here&#8217;s a system which works for me:

  * <span style="line-height: 14px;">I feed my starters once every 24 hours.Â </span>
  * I feed my white wheat starter with 50 g of water and 50 g of bread flour.
  * I feed my rye starter with 50 g of water and 50 g of dark rye flour.

If you don&#8217;t bake very much bread, you can keep your starter in the fridge, and feed it once every week.

This is what a white wheat starter looks like 24 hours after feeding.
