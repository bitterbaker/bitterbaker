_I usually put all my bread in the freezer right away. That way I can take out a roll or two and have them fresh whenever I want to._ 

Sprinkle oat bran on your working bench. Tip out the dough onto the oat bran and sprinkle more oat bran on top of the dough. Stretch into a square and cut the dough in 16 squares. Place them on a greased oven tray and let rise, covered with a kitchen towel, until doubled in size, 2-3 hours.

Preheat oven to 500°F. Spray some water on the bottom of the oven and bake the bread for 10 minutes. Lower the temperature to 450°F and bake another 10-15 minutes.

Let cool on a rack.
