I got a healthier treat for you today! They&#8217;re actually pretty fun to make, because you get to go loose on them with a fork. Who doesn&#8217;t like a bread that lets you do some fork stabbing?

Fork stabbing has always been my specialty. When I was little, I was in charge of fork stabbing the scones before they went into the oven (hm, maybe I should make some one of these days). The more holes I made, the better I was, I thought. Don&#8217;t know if the rest of my family agreed.

Isn&#8217;t it nice when childhood memories come back to you, just like that? The best part about these rolls are their rustic (and healthy) feel. But don&#8217;t worry, you&#8217;re not biting into a piece of brick. Oats and wheat bran (and flaxseeds!) are great to put in bread, we should do it more often!

_The holes are the result of my fierce fork stabbing._

**Wheat bran, oats and anise rolls**
  
_Total time: 12 hours to let the pre-dough get active. Then another 6 hours to stretch and fold the dough, let the dough rise and shaping the buns. Makes large 12 rolls._

**Ingredients**
  
_Day 1_

  * 75 g (2.6 oz) rye starter
  * 475 g (16.8 oz, not fluid!) filtered water
  * 265 g (9.3 oz) bread flour

_Day 2_

  * 1 tbsp sea salt
  * 1 tbsp honey
  * ¾ tbsp anise seeds
  * 1 cup oats
  * 25 g (0.9 oz) flaxseeds
  * 25 g (0.9 oz) wheat bran
  * 355 g (12.5 oz) bread flour

**Toppings**
  
graham flour

**Instructions**
  
Mix rye starter, water and bread flour in a bowl. Wrap with cling wrap and let the pre-dough rest in room temperature until it is <a title="What an active pre-dough looks like" href="/what-an-active-pre-dough-looks-like/" target="_blank">active</a>, about 12 hours. By this time it should look all bubbly. Mix in sea salt, honey, crushed anise seeds (<a title="Someone stole my mortar. What do I use instead?" href="/someone-stole-my-mortar-what-do-i-use-instead/" target="_blank">if you don’t have a mortar, use a garlic press</a>), oats, flaxseeds and wheat bran. Add the bread flour last, the dough should be a little sticky. Take out the dough on a lightly oiled surface and give it a stretch-and-fold treatment (i.e. first fold it right over left, then left over right, then bottom over top and lastly top over bottom (or in whatever order you like)). Put the dough seamside down in a lightly oiled bowl and let it rest 30 minutes. Give the dough four more stretch-and-fold treatments, and let it rest half an hour in between each treatment.

Let the dough rise in the bowl covered with a kitchen towel until it has doubled, about 2-3 hours. Divide the dough in 12 pieces. Roll each piece into a round ball. Flatten the ball (press down on it with your hands) and dip it in graham flour. Place the rolls on a greased oven tray and let them rise another 2 hours.

Place a casserole dish full of water in the oven and preheat it to 500°F. Take a fork and stab (excuse my language!) your rolls a few times. Put in the rolls and lower the temperature to 460°F. Bake for 15 minutes, then lower the temperature to 390°F. Continue to bake 10 minutes, until the rolls have gotten som color and sound hollow when you knock on the bottom. Let cool on a rack.
