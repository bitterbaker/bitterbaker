A little while ago, Kate at Foodbabbles (hi Kate!) shared a <a href="http://foodbabbles.com/2012/12/champagne-bread-twelveloaves/" target="_blank">champagne</a> bread that looked truly amazing. It got me thinking – beer is great to put in bread; what about wine? Throw some cheese in there and you got your wine and cheese night baked in a little bun. Can&#8217;t be much more convenient than that.

I&#8217;m thinking maybe a white Riesling wine would be good? What do you think? Ever tried to make wine bread? Would love all your input on this one!

In lack of wine, I had half a bottle of apple cider at home. Why not put that in bread, I thought, and sure enough – it&#8217;s so awesome! You&#8217;ll love it. They are slightly sweet (the dough actually smelled like fruit yoghurt before I baked the buns), and has that extra resistance when you pull it apart. I like my rolls chewy! I totally see myself eating this with marmelade or maybe a slice of brie cheese (if only I had some at home).

_I used apple-cranberry cider, but just about any type of cider would be perfect for this bread._ 

**Apple cider rosetta rolls**

_Total time: 12 hours to let the pre-dough get active. Then another 6-7 hours to let the dough rise and baking the bread. Makes 24 rosetta rolls._

**Ingredients**
  
_Day 1_

  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">110 g (3.9 oz) white starter</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">50 g (1.8 oz, not fluid!) filtered water</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">50 g (1.8 oz) bread flour</span>

_Day 2_

  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">402 g (14.2 oz, not fluid!) sparkling apple-cranberry cider (approx 2 cups)</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 tsp sea salt</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">600 g (21.2 oz) bread flour</span>

**Toppings**
  
poppy seeds

**Instructions**
  
Mix white starter, water and bread flour in a bowl. Wrap with plastic wrap and let sit in room temperature for about 12 hours, until the pre-dough is active and bubbles have appeared. Mix in sea salt and apple cider. Add the bread flour, a little at a time. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and let rise for about 3 hours.

Divide the dough in 24 pieces. Roll rosetta rolls (<a title="Roll a rosetta" href="/roll-a-rosetta/" target="_blank">see pictures here</a>). Place the rosetta rolls on a greased oven tray. Let rise in room temperature 2-3 hours. Put a casserole dish full of water in the oven and preheat it to 500°F.  Brush the rosetta rolls with water and sprinkle poppy seeds on top. Put them in the oven and turn down the temperature to 460°F. Bake for 20 minutes. Let cool on a rack.

_The taste of the apple cider is there, but if you don&#8217;t know what it is, apple cider probably wouldn&#8217;t be your first guess._

_I should probably get some brie cheese to keep these lonely rolls company?_
