Fruit in breads is not really my thing. I would never eat banana bread. Or banana scones. Or anything that contains mushy, soft bananas. And you&#8217;ll probably never find me eating an oatmeal raisin cookie. Or one of those rye dinner rolls that has raisins in it. Whenever I eat traditional christmas <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffron_bun" target="_blank">saffron buns</a> in Sweden, I always pick out the raisins. Or when I&#8217;m too lazy to take them out, I swallow them whole so I don&#8217;t have to taste it.

Don&#8217;t ask me why I&#8217;m so weird. I like eating raw bananas. I like raw raisins. It&#8217;s just when they come baked in a bun that I cringe.

So apples. I made apple bread once. It was okay. It made my house smell like apple sauce, which was awesome. But it was just _weird_ biting in to a dark rye bread, and all of a sudden there&#8217;s just this little piece of apple sweetness. I still believed in the apple thing though, so I took the least sweet apple I could find, grated it and paired it up with caraway seeds. Can&#8217;t say I regret it. Turned out caraway and granny smith were like made for each other.

_The apple taste is not the most distinct flavor, it&#8217;s there in the background, but just barely. Most of all, the apple gives the bread an incredible moist._ 

**Whole wheat caraway apple bread**
  
_Total time: 12 hours to let the pre-dough get active. Then another 5-6 hours to let the dough rise and baking the bread. Makes 18 mini loaves or 2 large loaves. _

**Ingredients**
  
Day 1

  * 75 g (2.6 oz) rye starter
  * 355 g (12.5 oz, not fluid!) filtered water
  * 150 g (5.3 oz) whole wheat flour

Day 2

  * 1 tbsp sea salt
  * 1 tbsp honey
  * 0.5 tbsp caraway seeds
  * 1 large grated Granny Smith apple
  * 540 g (19 oz) bread flour

**Toppings**
  
caraway seeds

**Instructions**
  
Mix rye starter, water and whole wheat flour in a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit in room temperature for 12 hours, until the <a title="What an active pre-dough looks like" href="/what-an-active-pre-dough-looks-like/" target="_blank">pre-dough is active</a>. Add sea salt, honey, crushed caraway seeds, grated apple and bread flour. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and let rise 3-4 hours, until doubled in size. Take out the dough on a floured working bench and shape into 18 mini loaves or 2 large loaves. Put them in greased loaf pans. Let rise 1-2 hours.

Put a casserole dish full of water in the oven and preheat it to 460°F. Brush the loaves with water and sprinkle caraway seeds on top. Bake the mini loaves like this: Bake at 460°F for 15 minutes, then lower the temperature to 390°F and bake for another 10 minutes, until they are golden brown and sound hollow when you knock on the bottom. Bake the large loaves like this: Bake at 460°F for 15 minutes, then lower the temperature to 390°F and bake further until the loaves are done, approximately 15 minutes. Let cool on a rack.

_So this is a mini loaf. Just saying. I suppose the apple is larger than normal, too._

_It&#8217;s whole wheat, too. _
