**Ingredients**
  
1 stick butter (113 g)
  
1 cup all-purpose flour
  
1 tsp baking powder
  
½ cup sugar
  
1/3 cup maple syrup

**Toppings**
  
sliced almonds

**Directions**
  
Preheat the oven to 390°F. Mix butter, maple syrup and sugar in a bowl. In another bowl, mix flour and baking powder. Add the flour mix to the butter mix and blend to a cookie dough. Grease an oven tray and shape the dough into two long rectangular shapes. Each shape should be about as long as the oven tray itself and 2 inches wide. Press down on the dough with your fingers so that the shapes are about 1/2 inch high. Sprinkle sliced almonds on top. Bake in the oven for about 15 minutes. They should still be a little soft when you take them out. While they are still warm, cut them into thin rectangular shapes, about 1 inch wide (they will have perfect length if you slice the two rows of dough the way you normally slice a loaf of bread, sideways). Let cool.
