I think I&#8217;m getting better at the whole baguette making thing. Okay, not nearly as good as Yuko, from over at <a title="A Kitchen Blog" href="http://akitchenblog.wordpress.com/2013/01/09/baguette-sourdough/" target="_blank">A Kitchen Blog</a> (hi Yuko!), which is where I found this recipe. But I&#8217;m getting there, step by step. And you know what? I don&#8217;t think baguettes are supposed to be easy. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I would like them to be. But they clearly wouldn&#8217;t be one of our most beloved breads if they were so easy to bake. Right? And you should really try this recipe, because it&#8217;s by far the best baguette recipe I have ever tried. And when it comes down to it, it doesn&#8217;t really matter what they look like (the shaping part is what&#8217;s holding me down), it&#8217;s the inside that counts (well, and the crust, too).

_Just mix chili flakes and garlic with some olive oil, and you got the perfect dipping sauce for your sourdough baguette._

**Sourdough baguettes**

_Total time: 36 hours. Most of it is just waiting time. (Recipe adapted from <a title="A Kitchen Blog" href="http://akitchenblog.wordpress.com/2013/01/09/baguette-sourdough/" target="_blank">A Kitchen Blog</a>)_

**Ingredients**

  * 75 g (2.6 oz) white starter
  * 150 g filtered water (5.3 oz, not fluid!)
  * 0.5 tbsp sea salt
  * 212 g (7.5 oz) bread flour

**Instructions**
  
Mix flour and water in a bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let sit in the fridge 12 hours. Mix in the sourdough and then the salt. Take out the dough on your working bench and stretch and fold it for about 4 minutes, or until it looks like a ball. Let the dough rest in a lightly oiled bowl 30 minutes.

Take out the dough on a lightly oiled working bench. Fold the dough over itself four times (bottom over the top, top over the bottom, left over right, right over left). Put it back in the oiled bowl, seamside down and let it rest in room temperature half an hour. Repeat this step about 6 or 7 times (the stretch-and-fold treatment and the 30 minutes rest). Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise in room temperature for about 6 hours.

Put the bowl in the fridge and let it ferment for about 16-18 hours. Take out the bowl from the fridge and leave it out in room temperature for 1 hour.

Divide the dough into two parts, preshape them, and let them then rest on the counter for 15 minutes. Shape into baguettes (google if you want expert tips!). If you have a couche, put the baguettes there. If not, you can just flour a kitchen towel and put the baguettes on there (see picture). Let the baguettes rest for 1 hour.

_Homemade baguette couche; it&#8217;s easier than you think to work with what you have._

Preheat the oven to 500°F. Score the baguettes with a sharp knife. Put the baguettes in the oven, throw in half a cup of water on the bottom and quickly shut the oven. Turn down the temperature to 480°F and bake the baguettes for about 20 minutes. Let them cool on a rack.

_Baguettes, baguettes, baguettes. It&#8217;s a love-hate relationship making them._

_But they&#8217;re totally worth some love. See that inside?_
