The pictures are of when I made my <a title="Pizza monkey bread muffins" href="/pizza-monkey-bread-muffins/" target="_blank">Pizza monkey bread muffins</a>, but you can use this method for making any kind of monkey bread muffins (although I really do recommend you trying the pizza ones, they are delicious).

  * Roll out the dough to a square, approximately 15&#8243;x15&#8243;.

  *  Cut the dough into 8 long strips.

  *  Brush oil on the strips and sprinkle on your toppings.

  *  Make two stacks with four strips in each stack.

  *  Cut the stacks into five equally large pieces.

  * Grease a muffin pan and put each little stack in one muffin hole. Spread out the strips to the sides a little.
