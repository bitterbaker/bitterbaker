Do people ever try the recipes on the backside of the product that they&#8217;re buying? You know, like the fudge recipe on the back of the Marshmallow fluff jar? Because I really don&#8217;t, I never do.

For some reason, I just don&#8217;t like them. To me, they&#8217;ve always been the most uninspiring, dry and boring recipes you could make (some of them really are). But recipes on the backside of products should be the best recipes, right? Logically, I mean. These people make the product for heaven&#8217;s sake. If they don&#8217;t know the best way to use it, then who does?

_Cut them into whatever shapes you like. Squares, monkeys, feet&#8230;_

That&#8217;s kind of how I came to the conclusion that I should probably start trying all these (for me) untried recipes. And I&#8217;m slowly changing my negative attitude towards them (yes, swallowing my pride). Partly due to the recipe on the back ofÂ <a href="http://www.bobsredmill.com/" target="_blank">Bob&#8217;s Red Mill</a>Â dark rye flour. These rye crackers, you guys, are ahh-mazing. Crisp, delicate, and flavored with one of my favorite seeds â€“ caraway seeds.

_They&#8217;ll be gone before you know it._ 

I don&#8217;t know if this will scare you away from making these crackers or not, but I&#8217;m just going to go ahead and say it anyway.Â _They kind of taste like a whole wheat pie crust_. Which is pretty much a match made in heaven for me. I love pie crust. Especially whole wheat. It&#8217;s clearly the best part of any savory pie or quiche (okay, that does depend a little on the filling, but <em style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">generally</em> speaking). You really don&#8217;t have anything to loose on trying them anyway, because they don&#8217;t take more than 30 minutes to make.

Chop chop, off you go.

_The rye crackers are bland enough to go perfectly well with any kind of cheese. The one in the picture is Gruy_Ã¨_re, one of my favorites.Â _

**Bob&#8217;s Red Mill rye crackers**
  
_Total time: 30 minutes. Makes 25 crackers._

**Ingredients**

  * Â½ cup bread flour
  * Â½ cup dark rye flour
  * Â½ tsp sea salt
  * 1 tsp baking powder
  * 2 tsp caraway seeds
  * 4 tbsp butter
  * 2 tbsp milk

**Instructions**
  
Mix all the dry ingredients. Mix in the butter with your fingers (or in a food processor). Add milk and shape to a ball. Let the dough rest in the fridge a little while before putting it in between two sheets of parchment paper (non-stick) and rolling it out to a square (about 1/8 inch thick). Cut into pieces and prick with a fork. Place on an oven tray and bake in the oven at 460<b style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Â°</b>F for 8-10 minutes, until the edges are golden brown. Let cool on a rack and store in a container.

p.s. I have adapted the original recipe somewhat. Also, the original recipe calls for 1 tbsp evaporated cane juice. If you have that at home, go ahead and add it!

_Store them in a container and keep them handy for whenever you feel like a little snack!_
