_Total time: 1 hour to make the meringue and the ice cream, then 3-4 hours to let the ice cream cool. Then 5 minutes to put the cake together!_

 **Ingredients coffee custard ice cream**

  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">4 egg yolks</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">pinch of salt</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">½ cup powdered sugar</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">½ cup strong coffee</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">6 tbsp butter</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 cup heavy whip cream</span>

**Toppings**
  
2 cups blackberries, fresh or frozen
  
caramel sauce

**Instructions**
  
Start by making two meringue cakes. Heat up the oven to 305°F. Prepare a water bath by boiling water in a pot. Place a metal bowl on top of the water bath and put the egg whites, the sugar and the lemon juice in there. Beat with an electric beater until the meringue gets thick, for a good 5 minutes at least. Spread out the batter to two equally large round cakes (approx. 9 inches in diameter) on baking sheets. Bake at the lower rack of the oven for 1 hour. Take out the meringue and let cool thoroughly.

Meanwhile, make the coffee ice cream. Again, prepare a water bath by boiling water in a pot (or use the same one). Place a metal bowl on top of the water bath and mix egg yolks, powdered sugar, coffee and a pinch of salt in the bowl. Whip by hand over the water bath until the coffee custard gets foamy and thick, it’s a fairly quick process. Take the metal bowl off the water bath and add the butter, 1 tbsp at a time. Let the coffee custard cool. Meanwhile, whip the whip cream so that it gets thick. When the coffee custard is cool, mix the whipped whip cream and the coffee custard in a bowl and pour it into a round spring pan (9 inches in diameter). Freeze the ice cream for at least 3-4 hours.

If you’re using frozen blackberries, defrost them in the microwave, and then mush them to a sauce with a fork (do the same thing with fresh blackberries, except you don’t need to microwave them). If it&#8217;s really watery, just pour some of the juice out.

Time to put the cake together! Peel off the meringues off of the baking sheets. Make one cake the bottom layer. Take out the coffee ice cream from the freezer and place on top of the meringue. Spread out the blackberry sauce on top of the coffee ice cream. Place the second meringue on top of the blackberry layer and top off with some caramel sauce. All done!

Small tip: If you’re not eating the cake right away, let it wait in the freezer. Take out the cake about 20 minutes before you want to eat it, that’s when it will taste the best!
