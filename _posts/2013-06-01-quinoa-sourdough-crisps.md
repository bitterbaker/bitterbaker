_Total time: 24 hours to make the soaker and let the pre-dough get active. Then another 3-4 hours to let the dough rise, and finally 2 hours to roll out the dough and baking the crispbread. Makes a lot of crispbread._

_Day 1_

  * ½ cup dry quinoa

_Soaker:_

  * 1 cup wheat germ
  * 1 cup oat bran
  * ½ cup flaxseeds
  * 90 g (3.2 oz) dark rye flour
  * 50 g (1.8 oz) spelt flour
  * 1 tbsp sea salt
  * 1 tbsp caraway seeds
  * 2 cups boiling water

_Pre-dough:_

  * 74 g (2.6 oz) rye starter
  * 300 g (10.6 oz, not fluid!) filtered water
  * 300 g (10.6 oz) dark rye flour

 _Day 2_

  * 2 tbsp honey
  * 1 grated apple
  * 514 g (18.1 oz) whole wheat flour

**Toppings**
  
sea salt
  
poppy seeds
  
sunflower seeds
  
flaxseeds
  
sesame seeds

**Instructions**
  
Cook the quinoa according to the instructions on the package. Let it cool in a bowl and put it in the fridge so it&#8217;s ready for the next day when you&#8217;re making the dough. Prepare the soaker by first toasting wheat germ, oat bran and flaxseeds in the oven at 375°F for 6-8 minutes. Let it cool and put them in a bowl. Add dark rye flour, spelt flour, caraway seeds and sea salt. Add 2 cups of boiling water and mix well. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it cool in room temperature for 24 hours. Make the pre-dough by mixing rye starter, water and dark rye flour in a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let that too sit in room temperature for 24 hours.

_With cream cheese and arugula. Uhm, yes, those are raspberries in the background. I just thought they looked pretty._ 

If you have strong arms, go ahead a mix the cooked quinoa, soaker and pre-dough together, but it&#8217;s a lot of dough! So if you have a large mixer, I&#8217;d suggest using that. My KitchenAid was barely large enough for all the dough, but it worked.. After mixing the three together, add honey, 1 grated apple and whole wheat flour. The dough will be sticky, but that&#8217;s okay, you&#8217;ll use plenty of flour when you roll it out. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and let the dough rise for 3-4 hours.

_Flaxseeds, poppy seeds, sea salt, sesame seeds. You&#8217;re favorite toppings are calling you._ 

Take a piece of the dough and roll it out to a thin pancake. Use lots of flour! Put the pancake on a greased oven tray and brush of the flour remaining on the top. Brush the dough with water (or use a spray bottle), sprinkle your favorite toppings on top of the dough and then cut it into pieces, in whatever size and shape you like (if you&#8217;re patient enough, you can use cookie cutters as well!). <a title="How to make crisp bread" href="/how-to-make-crispbread/" target="_blank">See a picture tutorial on how to make crispbread here</a>. Bake in the middle of the oven at 480°F for 5-8 minutes. Keep an eye on them after 5 minutes, they burn easily! Let the crispbread cool on a rack.

If the crispbread is slightly soft when it has cooled, that&#8217;s okay. I usually turn my oven to 170°F and bake them (all of them at once, stacked on top of each other on the oven tray) for another 20-30 minutes, or until they are completely dry.
