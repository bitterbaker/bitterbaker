Apparently, poolish is a term used in French and Italian baking and refers to a wet dough which you let ferment for a certain amount of time. This allows the dough to develop more flavors.

I have no idea what the official criteria is, but this is what my poolish looks like. It works for me.

This is what my poolish looks like after 12 hours.
