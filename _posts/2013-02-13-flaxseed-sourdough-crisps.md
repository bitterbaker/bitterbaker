**Ingredients**
  
_Day 1_

  * 80 g (2.8 oz) white starter
  * 350 g (12.3 oz, not fluid!) filtered water
  * 200 g (7.1 oz) bread flour

_Day 2_

  * 1 tbsp sea salt
  * 2 tbsp honey
  * ¼ cup canola oil
  * 100 g (3.5 oz) flaxseed meal
  * 100 g (3.5 oz) whole wheat flour
  * 200 g (7.1 oz) bread flour

**Toppings**
  
sea salt
  
poppy seeds

**Instructions**
  
Mix starter, water and bread flour in a bowl. Wrap with plastic wrap and let sit in room temperature for about 12 hours, until the pre-dough is <a title="What an active pre-dough looks like" href="/what-an-active-pre-dough-looks-like/" target="_blank">active</a>. Mix in sea salt, honey, canola oil, flaxseed meal, whole wheat meal and bread flour. Let rise in the bowl for about 3 hours.

Preheat the oven to 480°F. Take little pieces of the dough and roll it out thin on a floured working bench. Use cookie cutters to shape the crisps into hearts. Place on greased oven trays, brush with water and sprinkle on your toppings . Bake at 480°F for about 4-6 minutes. Keep an eye on them after 4 minutes to make sure they don&#8217;t burn! <a title="How to make crisp bread" href="/how-to-make-crispbread/" target="_blank">Here&#8217;s</a> more detailed instructions on how to roll out and make crisp bread (the only difference is that I cut out the cookies on the counter, not on the tray, but either way works!).
