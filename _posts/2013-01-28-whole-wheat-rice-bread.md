Rice has been on my list over things to put in bread for a while now, and I don&#8217;t regret doing it. It was really, really good. Can&#8217;t wait to try all other kinds of rice – black rice, wild rice, brown rice..

It&#8217;s so hard to describe the taste of bread. It doesn&#8217;t say very much if I just tell you that it was _good_.  Like I did above. But I had to. Because it was really good. Other than that, it was moist – as in really moist. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever had a bread this moist before. The sourdough flavor really comes out, too. And the poppy seeds inside was a really good call. Know how irritating it can be when you top your bread with them, and they just fall off before you have a chance to put them in your mouth? And you have to pick up each and everyone from the plate with your finger? Not with this bread. You won&#8217;t get away from the yummy taste of poppy seeds. It&#8217;s all in there.

_This has got to be the perfect bread for a wedding, right?_

**W****hole wheat rice bread**

_Duration: 18-20 hours to let the pre-dough get active. Then another 5 hours to let the dough rise and baking the loaves. Makes 2 large loaves._

**Ingredients**
  
_Day 1_

  * 1 cup dry jasmine rice

  * 120 g (4.2 oz) rye starter
  * 510 g (18 oz, not fluid!) filtered water
  * 260 g (9.2 oz) whole wheat flour

_Day 2_

  * 1 tbsp sea salt
  * 1 tbsp honey
  * ¼ cup poppy seeds
  * 520 g (18.3 oz) bread flour

**Toppings**
  
sesame seeds
  
poppy seeds

**Directions**
  
Mix rye starter, filtered water and whole wheat flour in a bowl. Wrap the bowl with cling wrap and let sit in room temperature for 18-20 hours, until <a title="What an active pre-dough looks like" href="/what-an-active-pre-dough-looks-like/" target="_blank">the pre-dough is active, looking nice and bubbly</a>.

While the pre-dough is getting active, cook 1 cup of jasmine rice according to the instructions on the package. Let the rice cool.

Mix in the cooled rice with the pre-dough, re-use the cling wrap and let the bowl sit in room temperature for another 2 hours.

Add sea salt, honey, poppy seeds and bread flour to the pre-dough, and knead to a firm, slightly sticky dough. Shape into two loaves and put them in two greased loaf pans. Cover with a kitchen totwel and let rise until they have doubled in size, 2-3 hours.

Preheat the oven to 460°F. Brush the loaves with water and sprinkle sesame seeds on top. Place the loaves on the lower rack of the oven and throw in 2/3 cup of water on the bottom of the oven. Bake the loaves for 25 minutes. Then turn down the temperature and continue baking the loaves until they have a nice color and are cooked all the way through, about 20 minutes. <a title="Knock, knock.

_Just imagine what great sandwiches you could make with this bread._
