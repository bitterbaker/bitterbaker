**Ingredients**
  
_Day 1_

  * 110 g (3.9 oz) white starter
  * 410 g (14.5 oz, not fluid!) filtered water
  * 290 g (10.2 oz) bread flour

_Day 2_

  * 1 tbsp sea salt
  * 1 tbsp honey
  * ¾ cup sundried tomatoes in oil
  * 1 tbsp Italian seasoning/herbs
  * 35 g (1.2 oz) semolina flour
  * 330 g (11.6 oz) bread flour

**Toppings**
  
olive oil
  
sea salt

**Directions**
  
Start by mixing the starter, filtered water and bread flour in a bowl. Wrap the bowl with cling wrap and let sit in room temperature for about 12 hours, until you have an <a title="What an active pre-dough looks like" href="/what-an-active-pre-dough-looks-like/" target="_blank">active pre-dough</a>.

Chop the sundried tomatoes (marinated in oil), into small pieces. Add sea salt, honey, the chopped tomatoes and the Italian seasoning to the pre-dough. Stir well, then add the semolina flour and the bread flour. Let the dough rest in the bowl for about 2 hours, covered with a kitchen towel.

Take out the dough on your working bench. Divide it in two pieces and roll out one piece to a 15”x15” square (see <a title="How to make monkey bread (muffins)" href="/how-to-make-monkey-bread-muffins/" target="_blank">pictures of how to make monkey bread muffins here</a>). Cut the square into eight long strips. Brush olive oil and sprinkle sea salt on each strip. Make two stacks, four strips in each stack. Cut each stack into five pieces. Grease a muffin pan and place one stack in each muffin form. Spread out the dough strips, so they look fanned out. Repeat the process with the second piece of dough. Cover the muffin pans with kitchen towels and let rest for about 2 hours.

Place a casserole dish full of water on the lower rack and preheat the oven to 460°F. Bake each tray for 15 minutes, until <a title="Knock, knock. Who can tell me when my bread is done?" href="/how-to-know-when-the-bread-is-done/" target="_blank">the rolls are cooked all the way through</a>.

Let the monkey muffins cool on a rack.
