Sometimes it feels like overkill to make sourdough bread. I mean, it tastes great, and overall I think it&#8217;s worth it, but you can&#8217;t really get away from that it takes time. Hours. Although most of it&#8217;s waiting time, still, it takes hours.

_Wanna see what&#8217;s inside?_

Usually when I feel like this, I turn to my buttermilk breads. It takes no more than ten minutes to whip up the batter (no yeast needed!), and then it just goes in the oven. Voilà – done. You can&#8217;t find a better loaf than that, seriously. What is more, it&#8217;s stuffed with nuts, seeds, anise, caraway, fennel, wheat bran, wheat germ. Every bite is sensational, full of flavors. Good for you, good for your soul.

_Nuts and seeds, nuts and seeds, nuts and seeds._ 

It&#8217;s like a really good, dark, sourdough rye loaf, except it&#8217;s like ten times quicker to make. It does take an hour and half for it to bake in the oven, though. Ideally, the ultimate loaf would be done in 20 minutes.

Oh well, you can&#8217;t have everything.

_Why not make it a habit and make one loaf once a week?_

**Instructions**
  
Preheat the oven to 390°F. Mix buttermilk and molasses in a bowl. In another bowl, mix all the dry ingredients. Add the dry ingredients to the buttermilk and quickly mix to a dough/batter (will be rather loose!). Grease a loaf pan and spread out the batter evenly in it. Bake in the oven for 1.5 hours, until the loaf has reached an inner temperature of 97°C or 206.6°F. Take the loaf out of the pan and let it cool on a rack. Let it cool thoroughly before you cut it, to prevent the inside from becoming gooey.

Enjoy!
