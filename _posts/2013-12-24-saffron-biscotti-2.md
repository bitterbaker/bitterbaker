Greetings from Sweden! I&#8217;m taking a little holiday from the Pacific Northwest and will be enjoying the holidays overseas. So far so good, although the layover in Frankfurt on the way here was a teeny tiny bit too long for my taste&#8230;

If only I would have had some of these saffron biscottis to munch – they will absolutely knock you out. Not only are they easy to make, but it also never stops amazing me how much flavor one bite contains. They&#8217;re like little saffron flavor bombs. Every Christmas I make at least one or two batches – they disappear in a crunch!

_Lovely saffron crunch._

They also make a perfect holiday gift. Just wrap up a few in a see-through plastic bag, put a ribbon on it and you&#8217;re done. They will be much appreciated, I promise.

_Remember my <a title="Saffron Almond Crackers" href="/saffron-almond-crackers/" target="_blank">Saffron almond crackers</a>? They&#8217;re a good alternative if you&#8217;re looking for something not so sweet, but still with some saffron crunch._

**Saffron biscotti**
  
_Total time: 45 minutes to mix ingredients and bake the biscotti. Then time to let them dry in the oven until the oven has cooled down, or overnight. Makes 30-40 saffron biscotti. Recipe from <a href="http://www.recept.nu/leila_lindholm/kaka/mjol/mammas_supergoda_saffransskorpor/" target="_blank">Leila</a> (in Swedish). _

**Ingredients**

  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 stick butter (113 g)</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 g saffron (0.03 oz)</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">2 eggs</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">2/3 sugar</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">2 cups all-purpose flour</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1.5 tsp baking powder</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">2/3 cup sliced almonds</span>

**Instructions**
  
Melt the butter with the saffron in a pot. Set aside. Mix all the dry ingredients in a bowl, including the sliced almonds. Pour the butter in a bowl and add the eggs. Mix in the dry ingredients. Shape the dough to three rolls. Flatten them out (mine were about 12 inches long, 1 inch wide and ¾ inch tall) and bake in the middle of the oven at 350°F for 25 minutes.

Take the biscotti out of the oven and lower the temperature to 255°F. Cut the biscotti in pieces, about ½ inch wide. Put them back in the oven and bake at the lower temperature for another 10 minutes. Turn the oven off and let the biscotti dry in the oven until the oven has cooled down, or overnight.

Enjoy!
