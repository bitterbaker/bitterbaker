  * ¼ cup warm water
  * 1 tbsp active dry yeast
  * 2 tbsp sugar
  * 2 tsp sea salt
  * 4 cups all-purpose flour
  * 1 large egg
  * 2 tbsp melted unsalted butter
  * 1 ¼ cup warm milk

**Toppings**
  
cornmeal

**Instructions**
  
Mix warm water, yeast, sugar, sea salt and 2 cups of flour in a bowl. Add the egg, butter and milk and knead until a smooth dough. Add extra flour if you need it, but not too much, you still want a soft and moist dough.

_Serve with soft boiled eggs, or make a real eggs benedict if you have time._
  
Oil another bowl and place the dough in there. Cover with a damp kitchen towel and let rise until doubled, about 2 hours.

Sprinkle a work surface with cornmeal. Place the dough on the cornmeal and sprinkle the top with more cornmeal. Roll the dough into a 9 “x 15” rectangle, about ½ inch thick. Don’t stretch the dough. Cut out the muffins (use a 3-inch biscuit cutter if you have one, otherwise a glass in similar size). Reroll the scraps and cut out the rest of the muffins.

Heat a cast-iron skillet until very hot.

Place as many muffins in the hot pan as will fit without crowding. Immediately turn down the heat to medium so the muffins cook through without burning – 10-15 minutes per side. They should be a light hazelnut brown.

Let the muffins cool on a rack. Split with a fork before toasting. Store in a bag at room temperature for up to a week, or freeze them directly.
