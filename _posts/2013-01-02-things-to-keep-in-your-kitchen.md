I don&#8217;t like filling up my kitchen with new, specialty appliances, but there are a few things which I really find helpful when baking bread, and which I use all the time. As I find more, I&#8217;ll list them here.

  * **Scale.** If you don&#8217;t have one, get one! Measuring cups may seem simpler, but depending on how hard or loose you pack your flour in the measuring cup, you&#8217;ll end up getting very different amounts of flour.
  * **Thermometer.** It&#8217;s the most accurate, simple way to measure if your bread [is done or not](http://bitterbaker.com/?p=198).
  * **Scraper.** You&#8217;ll go crazy trying to drag and fold anything without a [scraper](https://www.google.com/search?q=bread+scraper&hl=en&tbo=u&source=univ&tbm=shop&sa=X&ei=smXwUJKuIO33igLk-IEw&ved=0CEwQsxg&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&bvm=bv.1357700187,d.cGE&biw=1272&bih=702&ech=1&psi=smXwUJKuIO33igLk-IEw.1357933121353.3&emsg=NCSR&noj=1&ei=smXwUJKuIO33igLk-IEw).
