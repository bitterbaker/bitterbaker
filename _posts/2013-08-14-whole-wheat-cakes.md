_The baking cups are only there for decoration. Didn&#8217;t actually bake the cakes in them. But I know you knew that already. So we&#8217;re all good. No confusion._ 

Add sea salt, honey, wheat germ, flaxseeds, anise, caraway, fennel and flour to the starter mix. Knead to a firm dough and let rise in the bowl for 2-3 hours covered with a kitchen towel. Take out the dough on a floured surface and divide it into 16 pieces. Flatten each piece into a thin pancake, ca. ½ inch thick. Dip the bottom in wheat germ and place on a greased oven tray. Let rise 2-3 hours, covered with a kitchen towel.

_(Pan)cake tower!_

Preheat the oven to 485°F. Punctuate the cakes with a fork and bake for 20-25 minutes until golden brown. The cakes should sound hollow when you knock on the bottom.

Let cool on a rack, covered with a kitchen towel to keep them soft.
