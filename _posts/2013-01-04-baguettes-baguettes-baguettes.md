It&#8217;s really hard to make good baguettes, and I&#8217;m gonna have to keep trying until they are perfect. This was an okay attempt though. Although I regret not putting a casserole dish full of water in the oven, I think that might have made the crust even more chewier.

**Wheat Bran Baguettes**

_Duration: 24 hours to let the poolish get active (and collapse). Then another three hours to let the dough rise and bake the baguettes.
  
Makes 4 baguettes._

**Ingredients**
  
_Day 1: poolish_

  * 115 g rye starter (4.1 oz)
  * 500 g filtered water (17.6 oz, not fluid!)
  * 415 g bread flour (14.6 oz)

_Day 2_

  * 1 tbsp sea salt
  * 25 g wheat bran (0.9 oz)
  * 1/4 cup canola oil
  * 375 g bread flour (13.2 oz)
  * 2 tbsp honey

**Toppings**
  
sesame seeds
  
poppyseeds
  
sea salt
  
caraway seeds

**Directions**
  
Make the <a title="What a poolish should look like" href="http://bitterbaker.com/what-a-poolish-should-look-like/" target="_blank">poolish</a> by mixing rye starter, water and bread flour. Let sit for 24 hours, until <a title="What a poolish should look like" href="http://bitterbaker.com/what-a-poolish-should-look-like/" target="_blank">the poolish has risen,</a> and collapsed. Add sea salt, honey, wheat bran, canola oil and bread flour. Divide the dough into four parts. Shape into baguettes by flattening the dough with your fingers, forming a rectangle, then roll it into a cylinder starting with the long side. Place on an oven tray and let rise for two hours.

Make cuts in each baguette using a sharp knife. Brush some water over them and sprinkle one topping on each baguette. Put a casserole dish full of water on the lower rack in the oven and preheat it to 460°F. Bake for 10 minutes, then lower to 390°F and bake another 15 minutes. Not sure if the baguettes are done or not? See <a title="Knock, knock. Who can tell me when my bread is done?" href="http://bitterbaker.com/how-to-know-when-the-bread-is-done/" target="_blank">how to know when your bread is done</a>.

_Sesame seeds is one of my favorite toppings. It just seems like they go with everything._
