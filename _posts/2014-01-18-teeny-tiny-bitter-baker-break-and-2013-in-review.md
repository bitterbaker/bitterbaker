I just realized that bitter baker has been live on the internet for more than a year now! It&#8217;s crazy how time flies, isn&#8217;t it? It always makes me really happy looking back at all the recipes that I&#8217;ve made, and I keep telling myself &#8220;Ooo, I gotta make this soon again!&#8221; as soon as I see something that makes my mouth water.

As this new year begins, I&#8217;ll have a lot on my plate. Since food blogging takes quite a bit of time (you food bloggers know what I&#8217;m talking about), I&#8217;ve decided to take a teeny tiny bitter baker break. Of course, all of the recipes will remain up on the site, and feel free to email me anytime, one of the things I love most about blogging is hearing from readers!

Some of my top favorites from this past year. Which one is yours?
