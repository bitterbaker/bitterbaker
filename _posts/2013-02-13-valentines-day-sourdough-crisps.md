I&#8217;m way behind guys, way behind. All the other food bloggers started posting Valentine&#8217;s Day recipes long ago. Like really long ago.

And I can&#8217;t compete with my go-to sites for delicious treats, like <a title="Sally's Baking Addiction" href="http://sallysbakingaddiction.com/" target="_blank">Sally&#8217;s Baking Addiction</a> or <a title="Crazy For Crust" href="http://www.crazyforcrust.com/" target="_blank">Crazy For Crust</a>, when it comes to heart-shaped chocolatey desserts (or whatever it might be). But still.. It&#8217;s nice to make something special for Valentine&#8217;s Day.. So what do I do? What do I know how to do?

Well, the obvious answer to that question is sourdough. I know sourdough (sorry by the way if I&#8217;m drowning you in sourdough recipes, I&#8217;m sure the recipes would work just as fine with active dry yeast – with some adaption). So here&#8217;s my little Valentine&#8217;s Day contribution – heart-shaped sourdough crisps!

<img class="pinthis" title="Valentine's Day Sourdough Crisp bread " alt="Valentine's Day Sourdough Crisp bread | bitterbaker.com" src="http://bitterbaker.com/images/heartshaped-sourdough-crispbread.jpg" width="600" height="399" />
  
_Another sourdough crisp bread favorite! I might not recommend eating them with heart-shaped sprinkles though. But that&#8217;s up to you._ 

**Flaxseed sourdough crisps**

_Total time: 12 hours to let the pre-dough get active. Then another 4-6 hours to let the dough rise and baking the crisps. Makes &#8230;. a lot. _

**Ingredients**
  
_Day 1_

  * 80 g (2.8 oz) white starter
  * 350 g (12.3 oz, not fluid!) filtered water
  * 200 g (7.1 oz) bread flour

_Day 2_

  * 1 tbsp sea salt
  * 2 tbsp honey
  * ¼ cup canola oil
  * 100 g (3.5 oz) flaxseed meal
  * 100 g (3.5 oz) whole wheat flour
  * 200 g (7.1 oz) bread flour

**Toppings**
  
sea salt
  
poppy seeds

**Instructions**
  
Mix starter, water and bread flour in a bowl. Wrap with plastic wrap and let sit in room temperature for about 12 hours, until the pre-dough is <a title="What an active pre-dough looks like" href="/what-an-active-pre-dough-looks-like/" target="_blank">active</a>. Mix in sea salt, honey, canola oil, flaxseed meal, whole wheat meal and bread flour. Let rise in the bowl for about 3 hours.

Preheat the oven to 480°F. Take little pieces of the dough and roll it out thin on a floured working bench. Use cookie cutters to shape the crisps into hearts. Place on greased oven trays, brush with water and sprinkle on your toppings . Bake at 480°F for about 4-6 minutes. Keep an eye on them after 4 minutes to make sure they don&#8217;t burn! <a title="How to make crisp bread" href="/how-to-make-crispbread/" target="_blank">Here&#8217;s</a> more detailed instructions on how to roll out and make crisp bread (the only difference is that I cut out the cookies on the counter, not on the tray, but either way works!).
