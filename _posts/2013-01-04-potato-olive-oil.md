**Ingredients**
  
_Day 1_

  * 210 g white starter (7.4 oz)
  * 400 g filtered water (14 oz)
  * 265 g bread flour (9.3 oz)
  * 850 g red potatoes (1.9 lb)

_Day 2_

  * 1 tablespoon sea salt
  * 2 tbsp honey
  * ½ cup olive oil
  * 475 g bread flour (16.8 oz)

**Toppings**
  
semolina flour
  
olive oil
  
sea salt

**Directions**
  
Mix starter, water and bread flour in a bowl. Wrap the bowl with cling wrap and let sit for 24 hours, until [the pre-dough is active, looking nice and bubbl](http://bitterbaker.com/what-an-active-pre-dough-looks-like/ "What an active pre-dough looks like")y. Boil the red potatoes (keep the peel on), mash them and let them cool. Add sea salt, honey, olive oil, mashed potatoes and bread flour to the pre-dough. It should be pretty sticky. Grease two loaf pans and dust them with flour. Divide the dough in two parts and put one part in each loaf pan. Let rise for two hours.

When the loafs have risen to approximately double size, brush some olive oil on top and pour some sea salt and semolina flour on top. Preheat the oven to 390**°**F. Put the loafs on the lower rack and throw in 1/3 cup of water on the bottom of the oven. After 30 minutes, move the loads to the middle rack and bake another 15 minutes. If they have reached an inner temperature of 207**°**F, but still do not have much color on top, there is always the trick of turning the oven on broil for a minute (you have to watch it though!).

Let cool on a rack.
