I may just have found my favorite kind of roll. It&#8217;s not the first time I&#8217;ve said it, I know (and you&#8217;ll have to forgive me, I&#8217;ll probably say it soon again). But these rolls were just made in heaven. They have roasted sunflower seeds in them. That&#8217;s a pretty big selling point, right?

_What do you say? Would you eat this?_

But I wasn&#8217;t going to settle with just ONE kind of seeds. No, I felt way more complete knowing that my rolls would have at least with two kinds of seeds in them. So I looked around in my kitchen. Pumpkin seeds? Caraway seeds? Naa. Not today. Flaxseeds? Hm. Tough one. Flaxseeds with sunflower seeds? Uhm. Yes, please.

_I love eating my rolls as a light afternoon meal, with arugula, tomatoes and some salt and pepper. Doesn&#8217;t get much better than that._ 

**Instructions**
  
Mix starter, water and bread flour in a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit in room temperature for about 16-24 hours, until the pre-dough is active, <a title="What an active pre-dough looks like" href="/what-an-active-pre-dough-looks-like/" target="_blank">looking nice and bubbly like this</a>.

Toast the sunflower seeds in the oven on broil until they are lightly brown. Add sea salt, honey, flaxseeds, sunflower seeds and bread flour to the pre-dough. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and let rest in room temperature for about 2-3 hours, until it has doubled in size.

Take out the dough on a floured surface. Divide the dough in 16 pieces. Roll each piece to a little ball, dip the bottom in flour and place on a greased oven tray. Cover the rolls with a kitchen towel and let rise until they have doubled in size, about 2 hours.

Preheat the oven to 460F. Brush the rolls with canola oil. Sprinkle sea salt and sunflower seeds on top. Put the rolls in the oven and spray some water on the bottom of the oven. Bake the rolls for 15-20 minutes at 460F.

_Arugula, cottage cheese, red onion, salt and pepper makes another great combination.Â _
