**Ingredients**
  
_Day 1_

  * 115 g (4 oz) white starter
  * 300 g (10.6 oz, not fluid!) filtered water
  * 150 g (5.3 oz) bread flour

  * 1 tbsp fennel seeds
  * ½ cup olive oil
  * 13 garlic cloves

_Day 2_

  * 0.5 tbsp sea salt
  * 2-3 tbsp honey
  * 450 g (15.9 oz) bread flour

**Toppings**
  
fennel seeds
  
sea salt
  
sesame seeds

**Directions**
  
Start day 1 by crushing the fennel seeds in a mortar (a garlic press works just as well). Press the garlic cloves in a garlic press. Mix the seeds and the garlic in a bowl with olive oil. Cover and let marinate in room temperature for 24 hours. After having made the garlic-fennel marinade, make the predough by mixing starter, water and bread flour in a bowl. Wrap the bowl and let it rest for 24 hours until the <a title="What an active pre-dough looks like" href="http://bitterbaker.com/what-an-active-pre-dough-looks-like/" target="_blank">pre-dough is active, looking nice and bubbly</a>.

Add the garlic-fennel marinade, sea salt, honey and bread flour and knead into a dough that is slightly sticky. Let the dough rise for about 2-3 hours.

Divide the dough into 32 little pieces. Roll out the grissinis until they are approximately 10 inches long and 0.5 inches wide. Twist them and place them on an oven tray. Brush water on the grissinis and sprinkle over your choice of toppings.

Preheat the oven to 350°F. Bake the grissinis until they are golden brown and crisp, turn them upside down after 25 minutes, and bake further until they have been in the oven for a total of 40-45 minutes (depending on how thick they are. If they’re still not thoroughly crisp, and they have a lot of color, just turn off the oven and let them dry in there over night).
