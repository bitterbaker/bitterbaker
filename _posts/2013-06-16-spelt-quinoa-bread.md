_Like always, one of my favorite toppings on bread is arugula and avocado. This time with a little bit of cream cheese. _

**Instructions**
  
Pre-cook the red quinoa according to the instructions on the package. Let cool in the fridge. Mix starter, water and bread flour in a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit in room temperature for 16-24 hours until the pre-dough is active, looking nice and bubbly.

Mix in sea salt, honey, spelt flour and the cooked quinoa in the pre-dough. Flour a bread basket with lots of flour, and place the round dough in there. If you don&#8217;t have a bread basket, just shape your dough into a round loaf. Sprinkle wheat bran on the bottom of the loaf (if it&#8217;s in the bread basket), or on top of the loaf if it&#8217;s on an oven tray, and let rise for 3 hours, until it has doubled in size.

_Love, love, love artisan bread. _

Preheat the oven to 500°F. If your dough was in a bread basket, turn the bread basket upside down and tip out the dough onto a greased oven tray. Spray some water on the bottom of the oven and bake the loaf for 15 minutes. Turn down the temperature to 390°F and bake another 40 minutes, until the loaf is cooked all the way through. If the bottom of the crust isn&#8217;t golden brown, but the loaf is cooked all the way through – just turn the loaf upside down and bake it for another 5 minutes.
