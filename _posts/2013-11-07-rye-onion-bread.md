This bread is, like, amazingly good. I&#8217;m not even joking. When it&#8217;s baking, it smells ten times better than when you&#8217;re baking just a regular loaf. I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s the onion. It has to be. Maybe the caraway seeds has something to do with it, too.

_Light, fluffy inside._

I got this recipe from the back of the dark rye flour bag from Bob&#8217;s Red Mill. After having tried the Rye crackers, I thought the onion bread must be decent, at least. Can&#8217;t say I was disappointed. I mean, look at the crust!

_Thick, lovely crust._ 

I tweaked the recipe a little. The original calls for yellow onions, and doesn&#8217;t tell you to roll up the dough the way I did (see instructions below). Looks pretty cool with the swirl on the side, don&#8217;t you think?

_Poppy seeds on top really does the trick!_

**Rye onion bread** (from <a href="http://www.bobsredmill.com/" target="_blank">Bob&#8217;s Red Mill</a>)
  
_Total time: 3.5 hours. Makes 1 loaf. _

**Ingredients**

  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">2.5 cups all-purpose flour</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1.5 cups dark rye flour</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">2 tbsp sugar</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">2 tsp sea salt</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 tbsp active dry yeast</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">2 tbsp caraway seeds</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">½ cup warm water (110-115°F)</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 cup milk, room temperature</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">2 tbsp olive oil</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 cup finely chopped red onion</span>

**Toppings**
  
poppy seeds

**Instructions**
  
Mix dark rye flour and ½ cup white flour in a bowl. Add sugar, salt, yeast and caraway seeds. Pour in the milk, hot water and oil, and mix to a batter. Add the chopped onion. Start adding the remaining white flour ½ cup at a time. Take out the dough on your working bench and knead it for 8-10 minutes.

Place the dough in a floured bowl, cover with a towel and let rise until it has doubled in size, about 1.5 hours. Take out the dough on a floured surface and roll it to a rectangular shape, 8&#215;18”. Roll it up to a cylinder and place in a greased loaf pan. Cover with a kitchen towel and let rise another hour, until it has doubled in size. Brush some water on top and sprinkle poppy seeds over the loaf.

Bake at 375°F for about 45 minutes, until the inner temperature of the bread is 207°F, and it sounds hollow when you knock on a bottom. Take the loaf out of the pan and let cool on a rack.

Enjoy!
