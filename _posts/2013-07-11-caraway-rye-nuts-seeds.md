_Day 1_

  * 60 g (2.1 oz) rye starter
  * 252 g (8.9 oz, not fluid!) filtered water
  * 250 g (8.8 oz) dark rye flour

_Day 2_

  * 1 tsp active dry yeast (+ 2 tbsp warm water)
  * 1 tbsp sea salt
  * 1 tbsp honey
  * 156 g (5.5 oz, not fluid!) filtered water
  * 65 g (2.3 oz) oat bran
  * 60 g (2.1 oz )flaxseeds
  * 1 cup of chopped walnuts, almonds and sunflower seeds
  * 0.5 tbsp caraway seeds
  * 220 g (7.8 oz) whole wheat flour

**Instructions**
  
Mix rye starter, dark rye flour and water in a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in room temperature for about 16-18 hours.

Activate the yeast in 2 tbsp of warm water. Toast the walnuts, almonds, sunflower seeds and caraway seeds in the oven. Add all the ingredients to the pre-dough and work the dough with a mixer for 7-10 minutes, by hand at least 15-20 minutes. It&#8217;s going to be a very sticky dough, but that&#8217;s just the way you want it. Let the dough rest in the bowl, covered with a kitchen towel, for about 30 minutes. Knead the dough further about five minutes with the mixer (or 10 minutes by hand).

_I&#8217;ve been doing the <a href="http://simplegreensmoothies.com/30-day-challenge" target="_blank">30-Day Green Smoothie Challenge</a> lately. So what you see in the glass back there is not purple poison, but the result of my own experimenting using leftovers from the challenge – blueberry smoothie with almond milk and cardamom. Not a bad combination folks, not bad._

Grease a loaf pan and place the dough in it. The easiest way is to use a silicone scraper. Wet your hands with water and even out the top of the dough.

_Keep the loaf whole wrapped in a kitchen towel, or slice it and freeze the slices. That way you can have fresh bread every day._ 

Let the dough rise, covered with a kitchen towel, for 70 minutes. Preheat the oven to 500°F. Spray some water on the bottom of the oven and bake the bread on the second to lowest rack for 15 minutes. Open the oven to let some steam out. Lower the temperature to 390°F and continue baking for 45 minutes.

Take the dough out of the loaf pan and bake another 10 minutes, this time at 355°F.

Let cool on a rack. It will take some arm muscles to cut the bread.. The crust will be pretty hard, but the inside is moist and delicious! Top with your favorite veggies or a soft boiled egg, and feel healthy like never before.
