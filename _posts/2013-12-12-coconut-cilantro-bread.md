_Total time: 2.5 hours. Makes 4 small loaves_

<img class="pinthis alignright" title="Coconut cilantro spelt bread | bitterbaker.com" alt="Coconut cilantro spelt bread | bitterbaker.com" src="http://bitterbaker.com/images/coconut-cilantro-spelt-bread1.jpg" width="450" />**Ingredients**
  
1 tbsp active dry yeast
  
3 tbsp warm water (110-115°F)
  
1 can coconut milk (the fatty, not the light kind!)
  
1 cup yoghurt
  
2 tbsp fresh minced cilantro
  
1 tbsp sea salt
  
500 g (17.6 oz) spelt flour
  
150 g (5.6 oz) all-purpose flour

**Toppings**
  
shredded coconut

**Instructions**
  
Activate the dry yeast in the warm water. Add coconut, yoghurt, cilantro, salt and spelt flour. Add the all-purpose flour, a little at a time, until you have a firm dough that is not sticky. Let the dough rise in the bowl covered with a kitchen towel until it has doubled in size, approximately 45 minutes.

Shape the dough into four round loaves and place on greased oven trays. Let rise covered with a kitchen towel for 1 hour, or until they have doubled in size.

Preheat the oven to 485°F. Spray some water on the bottom of the oven and put in the loaves. Decrease the temperature immediately to 410°F and bake for 25-30 minutes. When 10 minutes remain, sprinkle some shredded coconut on top of the loaves (if you quickly brush some water on top before, it will stick better). Let the bread cool on a rack.

Enjoy!
