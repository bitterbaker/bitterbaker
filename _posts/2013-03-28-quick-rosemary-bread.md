**Ingredients**

  * 1.5 cups milk
  * 1 tsp active dry yeast
  * 2 sprigs fresh rosemary
  * 1.5 tsp sea salt
  * 1 tbsp honey
  * 400 g (14.1 oz) bread flour
  * 0.5 tbsp olive oil

&nbsp;

**Instructions**
  
Heat up the milk to 110-115 F. Dissolve the active dry yeast therein and let sit for a few minutes. Add the minced, fresh rosemary, sea salt, honey and bread flour. Mix to a dough. Let sit for 5 minutes and then work in the olive oil. Put the dough in a floured bread proofing basket and let rise for 60-90 minutes, covered with a kitchen towel (if you don&#8217;t have a bread proofing basket, then just shape the dough to a loaf and let it rise on an oven tray).

_What do you say about adding some rosemary butter to this lonely slice of bread?_

_Have you ever tried to chew on fresh rosemary? It&#8217;s&#8230; uhm&#8230; intense. I just found that out._

Preheat the oven to 460F. Tip out the dough from the basket onto a greased oven tray. Place the loaf in the oven and spray some water on the bottom of the oven. Bake for 15 minutes. Lower the temperature and bake another 25 minutes. When 20 minutes remain of the baking time, move the loaf to the lower rack of the oven.

Let cool on a rack, then enjoy!

_Another 60-90 minutes and the dough will have doubled in size.. Don&#8217;t forget to put lots of flour in the basket. You don&#8217;t want to have to pull out the dough from it._
