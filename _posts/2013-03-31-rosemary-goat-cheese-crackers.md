These rosemary goat cheese crackers are just awesome. So delicate and crispy, with a distinct taste of goat cheese and fresh rosemary..

_Perfect for your next dinner party, or just about any occasion._

You can just eat them as they are. They don&#8217;t need an addition of anything else, really. But they certainly would go very well with some brie cheese. And call me crazy, but I actually tried them with some biscoff spread. Not bad. Not bad at all.

_Wine, cheese and crackers. My kind of night in._

**Rosemary goat cheese crackers**
  
_Total time: 30 minutes. Makes 25 crackers._

**Ingredients**

  * 1 cup all-purpose flour
  * 0.5 tsp sea salt
  * 1 tsp baking powder
  * 2 sprigs fresh rosemary
  * 0.15 lbs hard goat cheese
  * 4 tbsp butter
  * 1.5 tbsp water

**Instructions**
  
Mix flour, sea salt and baking powder in a bowl. Finely grate the hard goat cheese and mince the fresh rosemary, and add them to the flour mix. Mix in the butter with your fingers (or in a food processor). Add water and shape to a ball. Let the dough rest in the fridge for a few minutes before you put it in between two sheets of parchment paper (non-stick) and roll it out to a square (about 1/8 inch thick). Cut into pieces and prick with a fork (optional). Place on an oven tray and bake in the oven at 460°F for 7-8 minutes, until the edges are golden brown. Let cool on a rack and store in a container.
