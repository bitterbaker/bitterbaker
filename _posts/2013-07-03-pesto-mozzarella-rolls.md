_Total time: 2.5 hours. Makes about 30 dinner rolls._

These rolls were made for 4th of July 2013. Red = pesto. White = mozzarella. Blue = baking cups. I would at least like some credit for trying.. ðŸ˜‰

  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1.5 cups milk</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 tbsp active dry yeast</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 tbsp honey</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">0.5 tbsp sea salt</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 egg</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">550 g all-purpose flour</span>

**Toppings**
  
<span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">340 g (12 oz) fresh mozzarella</span>
  
<span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">80 g red pesto (3 oz)</span>
  
<span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">1 egg</span>
  
<span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">pine nuts</span>
  
<span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">sea salt</span>

**Instructions**
  
Heat up the milk to about 110Â°F. Mix in the active dry yeast and the honey and let it sit for a few minutes until the yeast is starting to foam up. Mix in sea salt, 1 egg and the flour and knead to a dough. Use more flour if you need to, you don&#8217;t want your dough to be unmanageable. Let the dough rise in the bowl for 1 hour, covered with a kitchen towel, or until it&#8217;s doubled in size.

_You&#8217;ll want to make these rolls. If not for your family, then at least for yourself._

_They might not be the most obvious 4th of July treats, but it&#8217;s the thought that counts, right?_ 

Take the dough out of the bowl and put in on a floured surface. Roll it out to a thin, rectangular pancake, about 1/4 inch thick. Spread the pesto evenly over the dough. Cut the mozzarella in thin slices and spread them out evenly over the pesto (the mozzarella will not cover the _entire_ rectangular). Roll the dough together, just like when you&#8217;re making cinnamon rolls, starting by folding in the edge of the long side. Cut the roll it slices, about 1/2 inch thick. Place in baking cups on oven trays. Cover with kitchen towels and let rise another 30 minutes to 1 hour, until they have doubled in size. Meanwhile preheat the oven to 460Â°F.

_Not the healthiest of treats. But delicious. Oh, did I already mention that?_

When the rolls have risen, brush them with egg and sprinkle pine nuts and sea salt on top. Bake in the oven for 10-12 minutes until golden brown. Let cool on a rack covered with a kitchen towel.

_Put them in the freezer as soon as they have cooled down, if you&#8217;re not planning on eating them the same day._

Enjoy and have a wonderful 4th of July!
