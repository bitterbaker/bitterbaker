I was thinking long and hard on what to make for 4th of July. Shouldn&#8217;t be too hard, right? But it was.

First I thought of making something sweet. But let&#8217;s be honest here, there are tons of food bloggers out there that are coming up with way more creative 4th of July sweets than I can ever think of. Sooo. I started to think of a yummy, savory roll that I could make.

_Can you spot the red, white and blue?_

I needed something red.. Sundried tomatoes? No matter how much I love them, I felt like I use them too often. You guys want variation, right? Good. So do I. So I came up with red pesto! I sent my husband to the store with the mission to find the most delicious red pesto ever. He found it. It was sooo good. Good enough to just spread on <a title="Healthy quinoa and caraway sourdough crispbread" href="/healthy-quinoa-and-caraway-sourdough-crisp-bread/" target="_blank">crispbread</a> and enjoy as is.

Let&#8217;s just pretend that it wasn&#8217;t made of sundried tomatoes.

_You&#8217;ll want to make these rolls. If not for your family, then at least for yourself._ 

The white ingredient was a no-brainer – I want mozzarella in my rolls!

But the blue thing&#8230; I thought of purple cauliflower, cabbage and eggplant – but couldn&#8217;t think of anything blue except for blue potatoes, and blue, edible flowers. And I wasn&#8217;t really sure how well those would go with pesto and mozzarella. If I would have had more time (which I didn&#8217;t), I might have thought of something.

_They might not be the most obvious 4th of July treats, but it&#8217;s the thought that counts, right?_ 

I had no choice but to go with Plan B – blue baking cups. That&#8217;s not cheating, right? Never mind that the blue color is the wrong blue color. And that they&#8217;re also green. Or that the mozzarella turned out more brown than white when the rolls were baked (yes, I know, I was shocked). Despite the tiny little details, they were still delicious. If I may say so myself. Soft, cheesy, pesto-y, nutty&#8230; All my favorite adjectives.

_Not the healthiest of treats. But delicious. Oh, did I say that already?_

**Red pesto & mozzarella savory dinner rolls**
  
_Total time: 2.5 hours. Makes about 30 dinner rolls._ 

**Ingredients**

  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1.5 cups milk</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 tbsp active dry yeast</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 tbsp honey</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">0.5 tbsp sea salt</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 egg</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">550 g all-purpose flour</span>

**Toppings**
  
<span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">340 g (12 oz) fresh mozzarella</span>
  
<span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">80 g red pesto (3 oz)</span>
  
<span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">1 egg</span>
  
<span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">pine nuts</span>
  
<span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">sea salt</span>

**Instructions**
  
Heat up the milk to about 110°F. Mix in the active dry yeast and the honey and let it sit for a few minutes until the yeast is starting to foam up. Mix in sea salt, 1 egg and the flour and knead to a dough. Use more flour if you need to, you don&#8217;t want your dough to be unmanageable. Let the dough rise in the bowl for 1 hour, covered with a kitchen towel, or until it&#8217;s doubled in size.

_Put them in the freezer as soon as they have cooled down, if you&#8217;re not planning on eating them the same day._ 

Take the dough out of the bowl and put in on a floured surface. Roll it out to a thin, rectangular pancake, about 1/4 inch thick. Spread the pesto evenly over the dough. Cut the mozzarella in thin slices and spread them out evenly over the pesto (the mozzarella will not cover the _entire_ rectangular). Roll the dough together, just like when you&#8217;re making cinnamon rolls, starting by folding in the edge of the long side. Cut the roll it slices, about 1/2 inch thick. Place in baking cups on oven trays. Cover with kitchen towels and let rise another 30 minutes to 1 hour, until they have doubled in size. Meanwhile preheat the oven to 460°F.

When the rolls have risen, brush them with egg and sprinkle pine nuts and sea salt on top. Bake in the oven for 10-12 minutes until golden brown. Let cool on a rack covered with a kitchen towel.

Enjoy and have a wonderful 4th of July!
