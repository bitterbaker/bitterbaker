All my hardcore sourdough friends out there – this loaf is definitely for you.

Because unless you&#8217;re completely in love with sourdough, you&#8217;ll probably feel like this loaf just takes too long to make. Which is understandable. Because it will take a few days for the bread to ferment in the fridge in order to develop all those tangy sourdough flavors. And it does require some stretching and folding&#8230; with waiting in between.

_Lots of tangy, sourdough flavors in this one._ 

For me – yup, it&#8217;s worth it. But I also happen to have a crush on crusts that are as thick and nicely browned like this one.

_Any fans of browned crusts?_

But let&#8217;s not be too over dramatic here. It&#8217;s not like you have to knead the dough for days, most of the time is just waiting time. Maybe we should see it as a patience test? Who&#8217;s with me?

_A must-try for the sourdough lover._

**Sourdough white loaf**
  
_Total time: 1 hour to prepare the dough. Then 3-4 days to let the dough ferment in the fridge. Then another 3 hours to let the dough rise and baking the loaf. Makes 1 sourdough loaf. _

**Ingredients**

  * <span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">100 g (3.5 oz) rye starter</span>
  * <span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">425 g (15 oz, not fluid!) filtered water</span>
  * <span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">580 g (20.5 oz) all-purpose flour</span>
  * <span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">1 tbsp sea salt</span>
  * <span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">1 tbsp honey</span>
  * <span style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;">1 tbsp olive oil</span>

**Toppings**
  
bread flour

**Instructions**
  
Mix starter, water, sea salt, honey and all-purpose flour in a bowl. Let the dough rest 5 minutes, then mix in the olive oil and work the dough for about 1 more minute. Put the dough in a new, lightly oiled bowl and let it rest 10 minutes. Take out the dough on a lightly oiled surface. Give it one stretch and fold treatment (fold the top of the dough over the bottom, the bottom over the top, left over right, right over left). Put the dough back in the bowl, seamside down. Let it rest 10 minutes and then repeat the process three times, for a total of four stretch and fold treatments. Let the dough rest 10 minutes in between each treatment. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough sit in room temperature for about 12 hours until it has started to show yeast activity. Then put the bowl in the fridge (keep the plastic wrap on) and let the dough ferment for 3-4 days.

_If you fold the dough so the seam faces up, it will crack nicely in the oven._ 

Take out the dough form the fridge and leave it in room temperature for 3 hours. Tip out the dough on a floured surface. Give it one stretch and fold treatment (same method as above). Let rest on a flour surface with a kitchen towel on top for 1 hour. Give it another stretch and fold treatment and let rest another 60 minutes, covered by a kitchen towel. Give it one final treatment, cover with a kitchen towel and preheat the oven to 450°F. Shape the dough to a loaf and put it into a loaf pan. Bake in the middle of the oven for 1 hour and 10-15 minutes. The loaf reaches an inner temperature of 97°C or 206.6°F when it&#8217;s done.

Let cool thoroughly on a rack.

_Sandwich bread, perhaps?_
