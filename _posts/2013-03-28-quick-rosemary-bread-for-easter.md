My Easter treat is just as late as my <a title="Valentine’s Day sourdough crisps" href="/valentines-day-sourdough-crisps/" target="_blank">Valentine&#8217;s Day</a> treat was. Hehe. Planning might not be my strong side. And before I disappoint you, this Easter bread does not come in the shape of a bunny. Or an egg. Not even as a lamb. No time for such creative adventures. And besides, last time I tried to make bread in the shape of a crawfish, it more or less looked like a fat turtle.

_Bread proofing baskets are a great innovation. It takes no effort whatsoever to create a beautiful bread._

Not to say that YOU shouldn&#8217;t go for it. I&#8217;ve seen lots of cute easter bunny shaped breads, like this one from <a href="http://www.cookistry.com/2012/04/bunny-bread.html" target="_blank">Cookistry</a>. I&#8217;m definitely going to try (really stressing _try_ here) it next year. But if you have the time, and patience (not my strong side either) to be that creative before next year, do come back and share your pictures! Nothing makes me happier than when people share their stories.

_What do you say about adding some rosemary butter to this lonely slice of bread?_

Three good things about this bread: it&#8217;s EASY, it&#8217;s delicious, and it&#8217;s quick. The added rosemary makes it go really well with any lamb dish on your Easter table. Just perfect if you thought about everything else and happened to forget about the bread (it happens, I know. It&#8217;s okay, you&#8217;re still my favorite reader).

_Have you ever tried to chew on fresh rosemary? It&#8217;s&#8230; uhm&#8230; intense. I just found that out._

**Quick rosemary bread**
  
_Total time: 2-2.5 hours. Makes 1 loaf._ 

**Ingredients**

  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1.5 cups milk</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 tsp active dry yeast</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">2 sprigs fresh rosemary</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1.5 tsp sea salt</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 tbsp honey</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">400 g (14.1 oz) bread flour</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">0.5 tbsp olive oil</span>

**Instructions**
  
Heat up the milk to 110-115 F. Dissolve the active dry yeast therein and let sit for a few minutes. Add the minced, fresh rosemary, sea salt, honey and bread flour. Mix to a dough. Let sit for 5 minutes and then work in the olive oil. Put the dough in a floured bread proofing basket and let rise for 60-90 minutes, covered with a kitchen towel (if you don&#8217;t have a bread proofing basket, then just shape the dough to a loaf and let it rise on an oven tray). Preheat the oven to 460F. Tip out the dough from the basket onto a greased oven tray. Place the loaf in the oven and spray some water on the bottom of the oven. Bake for 15 minutes. Lower the temperature and bake another 25 minutes. When 20 minutes remain of the baking time, move the loaf to the lower rack of the oven.

Let cool on a rack, then enjoy!

_Another 60-90 minutes and the dough will have doubled in size.. Don&#8217;t forget to put lots of flour in the basket. You don&#8217;t want to have to pull out the dough from it._
