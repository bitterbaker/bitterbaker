After the outstanding <a title="Healthy gingerbread granola" href="/healthy-gingerbread-granola/" target="_blank">gingerbread granola</a> (which is long gone, by the way), I&#8217;ve been craving more crunchy granola to have for my breakfast. So what do I do about it? I make some more, of course!

_Who&#8217;s up for some crunchy granola?_

In a way, it feels very luxurious to have your own home-made granola with fruits and yoghurt every morning. It&#8217;s pretty good for you, too. The only sweetener is a little bit of honey. Of course the nuts and seeds has lots of fat in them – but mainly the good kinds. Then again, you only need two tablespoons or so of the ready-made granola to enhance your yoghurt experience. All in all, I&#8217;d say you&#8217;re in very good hands when it comes to this granola.

_Serve in a wine glass to make every day feel special._ 

Then there is the flavor. There are so many options! What to choose? This time, I decided to go with cinnamon and a little bit of cardamom. When baking with cardamom, I&#8217;ve learned it&#8217;s easy to overdo it. It&#8217;s such a flavorful spice, and you really don&#8217;t need more than a little bit to get a nice touch of cardamom flavor.

_Can you count the nuts and seeds?_

Don&#8217;t feel like you have to eat this for breakfast, though. Use it for granola bars, as topping on a cobbler or fruity pie, in birchermüesli&#8230; you name it! Let your summer imagination flow.

**Cinnamon pumpkin granola**
  
_Total time: 5 minutes to mix ingredients, 25 minutes to roast in oven._ 

**Ingredients**

  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">2 cups rolled oats</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">2 cups hot cereal, with multiple grains</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 cup pumpkins seeds</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">½ cup chopped walnuts</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">½ cup flaxseeds</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">½ cup chopped cashews</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">½ cup sunflower seeds</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">½ cup chopped hazelnuts</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1.5 tbsp cinnamon</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">0.5 tsp cardamom</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 cup water</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">3 tbsp honey</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">½ cup canola oil</span>

**Instructions**
  
Preheat the oven to 390°F. Mix all the dry ingredients in a bowl. Add water, honey and canola oil. Spread out an even layer of granola on one or two oven trays (I used two since I can fit two trays in my oven). Roast in the oven for 25 minutes. Stir after every ten minutes, and keep an eye on the granola when five minutes is left, you don’t want it to burn! Let cool on the trays.

Serve with fruit and yoghurt.
