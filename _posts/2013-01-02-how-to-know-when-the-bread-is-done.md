As with meat, potatoes, pasta or whatever food you like – under- or overcooked bread does not taste very good.

Here are two tips on how to know when your bread is done.

  1. <span style="line-height: 14px;">The bread should have an inner temperature of 207°F (97°C). Stick a thermometer into the middle of the bread and check.</span>
  2. Turn the bread upside down and knock on the bottom, it should sound hollow.
