**Ingredients**
  
_Brownie squares:_

  * 2 eggs
  * 1 cup sugar
  * ¼ cup canola oil
  * 1 stick butter (113 g)
  * ½ cup all-purpose flour
  * 5 tbsp cocoa powder
  * 1/3 tsp vanilla extract

_Salty caramel toffee:_

  * 2 dl heavy whipping cream
  * 1 dl dark brown sugar
  * ½ stick of butter
  * 1 tsp sea salt
  * 1 dl maple syrup

**Toppings**
  
Marshmallow fluff

**Directions brownie cake**
  
Beat the eggs and sugar until light and fluffy. Melt the butter and mix with the canola oil. Sift the cocoa powder and blend with the flour. Add butter, canola oil and vanilla extract to the eggs and sugar. Then add cocoa powder and flour. Grease a 9” spring form pan and dust it with cocoa powder. Pour the batter in it and bake the cake at 350°F 15-20 minutes (mine took 17 minutes). It should still be loose when you take it out! Let the cake cool in the pan on the counter.

**Directions salty caramel toffee**
  
Put all ingredients in a pot, stir, and bring to a boil. Let it simmer about 30 minutes until the toffee has thickened. Let cool.

_The salty caramel topping is the perfect combination to a really rich chocolate brownie._ 

**Composing**
  
Cut the brownie cake in squares (which means that you will probably have some odds and ends over when you&#8217;re done). Spread some marshmallow fluff on top of each square (it&#8217;s easier if you heat up the fluff in the microwave first, although only for a few seconds!). Heat up the salty caramel toffee to make it loose, and pour it on top of the marshmallow fluff, use something sharp to draw pretty patterns in the caramel.

Let cool in the fridge, then enjoy!
