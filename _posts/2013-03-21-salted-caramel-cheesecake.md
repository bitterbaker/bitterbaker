I know it&#8217;s only Thursday, but if you want to have this over the top delicious treat ready for the weekend, you better get going! And believe me, you will want to make this cheesecake. Flavored with maple syrup and topped off with a mouthwatering salted caramel sauce. It&#8217;s heaven.

Although don&#8217;t do what we did. With two people in our household, it barely lasted two days. It was that good. We gave away two pieces, but that&#8217;s all. The rest was all us. It was just so creamy, and the (homemade!) salted caramel sauce was just so, so irresistible. Believe me, we didn&#8217;t want to eat it all, it just happened.

_The best of two worlds – salted caramel and cheesecake._

Can&#8217;t say it made me feel great though. So I&#8217;d advise you to just take one piece. Then all I have to do is learn to live like I teach.

Shouldn&#8217;t be that hard, right?

_Irresistible._

**Salted caramel cheesecake**

 _Salted caramel sauce_

_Something for your next dinner party, perhaps?_

**Instructions**
  
Bring a large pot of water to a boil (we will use it for the waterbath later) and preheat the oven to 350°F. Melt the butter and mix with the crumbled graham crackers. Press out the butter/graham mix in a 9” spring form pan. Bake at 350°F for 10 minutes.

Whip the cream cheese light and fluffy with a electric beater. Mix in sugar and maple syrup. Add sour cream and whipping cream, and beat a little further. Finally add the eggs, 1 egg at a time. Beat with the electric beater in between each added egg.

Turn down the oven temperature to 325°F. Pour the cream cheese batter in the spring form pan on top of the graham crust. Take aluminum foil and cover the bottom and the sides of the spring form pan.

Place the spring form pan in a large oven tray or an oven pan which sides go up at least half the height of the spring form pan. Put the oven pan/tray in the oven with the spring form in it. Take the boiling water and carefully pour it in the oven pan, so that the water reaches up to half the height of the form. Bake the cheesecake in the water bath at 325°F for about 70 minutes. The cheesecake should still be loose when you take it out. When you’ve taken out the pan, let the cheesecake cool in the water bath for 15 minutes, then take it out of the water and let it cool on a rack. Chill in the fridge for at least 8 hours or overnight. Don’t skip this step! The cheesecake really needs to be thoruoughly chilled in order to get the right consistency. If you eat it before that, it might be foamy.

When the cheesecake is cooling, prepare the salted caramel sauce by putting all the ingredients in a pot. Bring to a boil and let simmer 18 minutes, until it has slightly thickened. Stir every once in a while. Let cool, but don’t put it in the fridge. That will just make it stiffen.

When the cheesecake has cooled, remove it from the spring form pan and pour the salted caramel sauce on top. Voilà, done!

_I like to sprinkle a little bit of salt on top for that extra finish. _
