When I lived in Germany last year, I shared an apartment with three other girls, two from Sweden, and one from China.

They were three of the best roommates I&#8217;ve ever had. We would make Chinese Hot Pot one night, have delicacy cheese and crackers another night, and study German together whenever we felt like it.

_Lovely sourdough rolls filled with oat bran, oat flour and rolled oats._ 

Thanks to us three Swedes, our Chinese roommate probably still believes that every Swede has oatmeal for breakfast. Because that&#8217;s what we had. Every single day. We didn&#8217;t have the same kind of oatmeal of course, but we all had oatmeal. I had mine with chopped cashews, hazelnuts, walnuts and cinnamon. My other roommate had hers with milk and bananas. Our third Swede sometimes made hers with quinoa.

_Flavored with anise seeds, caraway seeds and fennel seeds. Whoever came up with that combination is a genius._

We tried to assure our Chinese friend that not all Swedes have oatmeal for breakfast. If I could make a guess, I would say most Swedes don&#8217;t (but I&#8217;m also not a big fan of making general assumptions, so take that with a pinch of salt).

I have absolutely no idea why I&#8217;m so into oatmeal. Most kids hate oatmeal growing up. I guess I didn&#8217;t loathe it growing up, but I for sure wasn&#8217;t crazy about it. Maybe it&#8217;s because I like cross country skiing. In my mind, they just seem to belong together. If you&#8217;re going cross country skiing – you need to have oatmeal for breakfast, that&#8217;s just the way it is. Where else would you get all the energy for all the exercising you&#8217;re about to do? It all makes sense, right?

_Just break off one piece at a time&#8230;_ 

I guess one of these rolls is as close as you can get to an oatmeal substitute. I put in everything in my cupboard that had the word &#8220;oat&#8221; in it – oat bran, oat flour AND rolled oats. You can see why an oatmeal fan would be into these rolls. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. And did I mention that they have fennel, caraway and anise seeds in them? Sourdough rolls at its best, that is.

_&#8230;or break off all of them at once._

**Instructions**
  
Mix rye starter, water and bread flour in a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest in room temperature for 20 hours, until the pre-dough is <a title="What an active pre-dough looks like" href="/what-an-active-pre-dough-looks-like/" target="_blank">active and full of bubbles</a>.

Mix in sea salt, honey, caraway seeds, fennel seeds, anise seeds, oat bran, oat flour, rolled oats and bread flour. Knead to a firm dough and let rise in a bowl covered with a kitchen towel for ca. 2.5 hours.

_The wheat germs gets toasted on top._ 

Take out the dough on a floured surface and divide it into 12 pieces. Roll each piece to a round ball and roll them in wheat germ. Grease a spring form pan and sprinkle some rolled oats in it. Place the balls in the spring form pan, cover with a kitchen towel and let rise until double its size, about 2 hours.

_Making bread in a spring form pan is one of my favorite ways to make bread – so easy and convenient._

Preheat the oven to 460°F. Spray some water on the bottom of the oven and bake the rolls for 15 minutes. Lower the temperature to 390°F and bake further for 30-35 minutes, until the rolls are golden brown and thoroughly cooked (should have an inner temperature of 97°C or 206.6°F). Take the loaf out of the pan and let cool on a rack.
