I always end up making too much bread at the same time. And there I am, with five trays of bread that has risen enough and needs to go in the oven before they collapse. An awesome trick here is to put the trays that don&#8217;t fit in the oven in the fridge. The coolness delays the rising process and you have (almost) all the time in the world to continue your baking.

Also, if you have just shaped your bread and need to rush off somewhere, letting your bread rise in the fridge during the day is a great idea. Just take it out in the evening and bake it as normal. Works perfectly.
