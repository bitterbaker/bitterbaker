Somewhere I read that baguettes are usually made with all-purpose flour as opposed to bread flour. Apparently this is because bread flour makes them tougher than they’re supposed to be. I don’t know if that’s true or not (that chewy baguettes are wrong, that is), but nevertheless it intrigued me to try making baguettes with all-purpose flour. I mean, I like chewy baguettes, but soft ones wouldn’t be so bad either, right?

_Spelt flour baguettes, my new, soft, favorite!_

Turns out they’re like THE softest baguettes I’ve ever tasted. They literally melt in your mouth. And the spelt flour gives them a healthier, nuttier taste, which makes them just so much better. Plus they have air bubbles in them (yay!!).

_Perfect crust._ 

I totally underestimated the wonders of the all-purpose flour. Won’t ever happen again, that’s for sure. Can&#8217;t wait to make more baguettes (it&#8217;s an addiction, I know) that are as lovely as this one. You guys should definitely give it a go. You&#8217;ll thank you later.

_And they&#8217;re full of air. Oh did I say that already?_

**Spelt flour sourdough baguettes**
  
_Total time: 1 hour to prepare the dough, then 3-4 days to let the dough ferment in the fridge. Then another 3 hours to bake the baguettes. Makes 4 spelt flour sourdough baguettes._ 

**Ingredients**

  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">100 g (3.5 oz) white starter</span>

  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 tbsp sea salt</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 tbsp honey</span>

_The hardest part about making baguettes is the shaping, and even though twisted baguettes isn&#8217;t the &#8220;true&#8221; shape of a classic baguettes, they taste just as good._ 

**Instructions**
  
Mix starter, water, sea salt, honey, spelt flour and all-purpose flour in a bowl. Let the dough rest 5 minutes, then mix in the olive oil and work the dough for about 1 minute.

Put the dough in a new, lightly oiled bowl and let it rest 10 minutes. Take out the dough on a lightly oiled surface. Give it one stretch and fold treatment (fold the top of the dough over the bottom, the bottom over the top, left over right, right over left). Put the dough back in the bowl, seamside down. Let it rest 10 minutes and then repeat the process three times, for a total of four stretch and fold treatments. Let the dough rest 10 minutes in between each treatment. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough sit in room temperature for about 12 hours until it has started to show yeast activity. Then put the bowl in the fridge (keep the plastic wrap on) and let the dough ferment for 3-4 days.

_Dip in soup, eat as they are, serve with brie cheese&#8230; The choice is yours._ 

Take out the bowl from the fridge and leave it in room temperature for 3 hours. You can leave the plastic wrap on. Tip out the dough carefully on a lightly floured surface. Cut it in four pieces. Carefully stretch them into rectangles, then fold them in thirds (<a title="How to fold in thirds" href="/how-to-make-croissants/" target="_blank">like I did here with the dough for the croissants</a>, steps 5-7. Just don&#8217;t roll out the dough quite as flat..). Place them on a lightly floured surface and cover with a kitchen towel. Let rest 1 hour. Gently stretch and fold them again, and once again cover with the kitchen towel. Let rest another 60 minutes. Fold them in thirds a third time (cover with kitchen towel), turn on the oven (to 500°F) and let them rest until the oven is warm.

_The spelt flour gives the baguettes a nuttier taste, which is a nice break from the regular all-white baguette._

Preheat the oven to 500 °F. Lightly dust the dough with some flour on the top side. Pick up one piece, and gently drag it out to a long baguette while at the same time twisting it a few times. Place the twisted baguettes on greased oven trays. Put the bread in the oven and throw in ½ cup of water on the bottom. Quickly shut the oven so the steam doesn’t escape. Bake for 10 minutes. Lower the temperature to 450°F and bake another 10-15 minutes, until the baguettes are golden brown.
  
Take the baguettes and let cool on a rack.

Enjoy!
