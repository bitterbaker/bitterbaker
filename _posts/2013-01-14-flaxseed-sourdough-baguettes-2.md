**Ingredients**
  
_Step 1_, p_oolish:_

  * 135 g (4.8 oz) white starter
  * 500 g (17.6 oz, not fluid!) filtered water
  * 400 g (14 oz) bread flour

_Step 2_

  * 1 tbsp sea salt
  * 2 tbsp honey
  * 0.5 cup flaxseed
  * 0.5 cup canola oil
  * 400 g (14 oz) bread flour

**Toppings**
  
flour

**Directions**
  
Mix white starter, water and bread flour to make the [poolish](http://bitterbaker.com/?p=240). Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let sit 9-12 hours, <a title="What a poolish should look like" href="http://bitterbaker.com/what-a-poolish-should-look-like/" target="_blank">until the poolish has risen and is bubbly</a>. Mix in sea salt, honey, flaxseed, canola oil and bread flour. It should be pretty sticky! Take out the dough on your counter and use a scraper to stretch and fold it for 5 minutes. Let it rest in a bowl for 45 minutes, then take it out and stretch and fold it for another 10 minutes. Let it rest for 45 minutes and stretch and fold it for 10 minutes. Let it rest for 45 minutes, then stretch and fold it a fourth time for 10 minutes. Put a towel on top of the bowl and let it rest in the fridge, 9-12 hours. Take out the bowl and let it rest in room temperature about 2 hours.

Take out the dough on your working bench. Divide it into four parts and shape into baguettes (it&#8217;s not a bad idea to google a few videos on this topic). Roll in flour and place on an oven tray to let them rise until they have almost doubled in size, about 2 hours.

Put a casserole dish full of water in the oven and preheat the oven to 460° F. Score the baguettes with a sharp knife and bake them for about 15 minutes. Then lower the heat to 390°F and continue baking until they are golden brown, about 15 minutes. See here to <a title="Knock, knock.
