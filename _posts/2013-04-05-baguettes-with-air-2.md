_Total time: 1 hour to make the dough. Then another 2-4 days to let the dough ferment in the fridge. Finally 3-4 hours to shape and bake the baguettes. Makes 4 baguettes._

**Ingredients**
  
_Day 1_

  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1.25 tsp active dry yeast</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">2 cups filtered water (450g, or 15.9 oz, not fluid!)</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">¾ tbsp sea salt</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">567 g (20 oz) bread flour</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 tbsp olive oil</span>

**Toppings**
  
bread flour

**Instructions**
  
Activate the yeast in warm water according to the instructions on the package. Add the rest of the water, salt and bread flour, and mix to a dough. Let the dough rest in the bowl 5 minutes, then mix in the olive oil, working the dough for about 1 minute. Put the dough in a new, lightly oiled bowl and let it rest 10 minutes. Take out the dough on a lightly oiled surface. Give it one stretch and fold treatment (carefully stretch it out to a square, then fold the top of the dough over the bottom, the bottom over the top, left over right, right over left). Put the dough back in the bowl, seam side down. Let it rest 10 minutes and then repeat the process three times, for a total of four stretch and fold treatments. Let the dough rest 10 minutes in between each treatment. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough ferment in the fridge 2-4 days (I took out mine on the third).

_Dip in soup, eat them as they are, or make a luxurious sandwich with them._

_You&#8217;ll be amazed over how easy these baguettes are to make._ 

Take out the bowl from the fridge and leave it in room temperature for 3 hours. You can leave the plastic wrap on. Tip out the dough carefully on a lightly oiled surface. Cut it in four pieces. Carefully stretch them into rectangles, then fold them in thirds (like I did here with the dough for the croissants). Place them on a lightly oiled parchment paper and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let rest 1 hour. Gently stretch and fold them again, and put the plastic wrap back on. Let rest 1 hour. Fold them in thirds a third time (put the plastic wrap back on), turn on the oven (to 500°F) and let them rest until the oven is warm.

_Holes! Giant holes!_

Preheat the oven to 500 °F. Lightly dust the dough with some flour on the top side. Pick up one piece, and gently drag it out to a long baguette while at the same time twisting it a few laps. Place the twisted baguettes on greased oven trays. Put the bread in the oven and throw in ½ cup of water on the bottom. Quickly shut the oven so the steam doesn’t escape. Bake for 10 minutes. Lower the temperature to 450°F and bake another 10-15 minutes, until the baguettes are golden brown.

Let cool on a rack, then get right to work and eat them all!

_I like to cut my baguettes slightly on the diagonal, to get the same look they often have at restaurants._
