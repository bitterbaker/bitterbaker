First off, don&#8217;t forget about tomorrow people! I&#8217;m joining <a href="http://seattleglobalist.com/" target="_blank">The Seattle Globalist</a> on a live <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/cduj4tsfc4ghdl6uvkqkn6rn04c" target="_blank">webcast show</a> at 3 pm PT. <a href="http://www.seattlefoundation.org/Pages/Default.aspx" target="_blank">The Seattle Foundation</a> is organizing a day of giving big, a day to donate to all the non-profits that make our society a better place to live. So share some love and <a href="http://www.seattlefoundation.org/npos/Pages/TheCommonLanguageProject.aspx?bv=nposearch" target="_blank">GiveBig</a>, you too! And of course, I&#8217;d be honored if you wanted to tune in at 3 pm to watch my 15 minutes of fame. I&#8217;ll be sharing a new recipe that has yet to be published here on bitter baker.

And now. What you&#8217;ve all been waiting for&#8230; the bread! No matter how greasy the name may sound, it&#8217;s actually not that bad. I like greasy pizza every now and then, but mostly I&#8217;m just after the taste of sundried tomatoes and the Italian herbs. Which is exactly what you&#8217;ll get with this bread. Pizza flavor minus the greasy part. Everybody wins, right?

_Five different kinds of cheese, and yet it&#8217;s not too greasy. Must be a magic bread, or what do you say?_

I never would have thought of making this loaf, if I hadn&#8217;t gotten this comment on my <a title="Pizza monkey bread muffins" href="http://bitterbaker.com/pizza-monkey-bread-muffins/" target="_blank">Pizza monkey bread muffins</a>: &#8220;These muffins look great! I wish there was some quicker way to make them ![:D](http://bitterbaker.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif)&#8220;. I totally understand, sourdough takes a lot of time sometimes – and time is not always something you have plenty of.

So of course, there sure is a quicker way to make them! But since I like trying new kinds of bread, I made this five cheese pizza loaf, which is even quicker than the muffins. All you have to do is throwing the dough in a spring form pan. Can&#8217;t be much easier and quicker than that.

_Make this next time your having an Italian themed dinner._ 

I&#8217;m totally in love with this bread. It&#8217;s so soft and moist, and literally melts in your mouth when you bite in to it. I warm it up just a tiny bit in the microwave and one, two, three slices later, I don&#8217;t even need to think about dinner anymore. After all, it&#8217;s called pizza bread.

**Five cheese pizza bread**
  
<em style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Total time: 2.5 hours. Makes 1 large loaf. </em>

**Ingredients**

  * 2 cups of warm water
  * 1 tbsp active dry yeast
  * 1 tbsp sugar
  * 0.5 tbsp sea salt
  * 2/3 cup chopped sundried tomatoes in oil
  * 1 tbsp Italian seasoning
  * 630 g (22.2 oz) bread flour
  * 1 tbsp olive oil

**Toppings**

  * 1 large egg
  * 1 cup <a style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;" href="http://www.sargento.com/products/223/sargento-chef-blends-four-state-cheddar-shredded-cheese/" target="_blank">Shredded 4 State Cheddar Cheese</a>
  * shredded parmesan

**Instructions**
  
Activate the yeast in the warm water together with the sugar for a few minutes. Add sea salt, sundried tomatoes, italian seasoning and bread flour. Knead to a dough (should remain a little sticky, but not unmanageable). Let the dough rest in its bowl for five minutes, then mix in the olive oil. Let the dough rise until doubled, about 1 hour.

Tip out the dough on a lightly floured working bench. Stretch it out a little and place the egg and the shredded cheese in the middle. Fold the sides over the cheese and egg, so they’re no longer visible. Take a dough cutter and start chopping the dough in little pieces. The egg and the cheese will make it into a gooey mass. When done, place the pieces in a greased 9” spring form pan. Let rise 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 350°F. Sprinkle some (or lots of) parmesan cheese on top of the monkey bread and bake for 1 hour.

Let cool in the spring form pan for about 10 minutes. Then take it out of the form and let cool on a rack before you cut in to it – this will allow the dough to cook all the way through and you don&#8217;t risk having doughy pizza bread.

_Looks kind of cool, cutting it like a cake, don&#8217;t you think? But it&#8217;s not sweet, I promise._
