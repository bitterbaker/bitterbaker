**Ingredients**
  
_Day 1_

  * 1 cup dry jasmine rice

  * 120 g (4.2 oz) rye starter
  * 510 g (18 oz, not fluid!) filtered water
  * 260 g (9.2 oz) whole wheat flour

_Day 2_

  * 1 tbsp sea salt
  * 1 tbsp honey
  * ¼ cup poppy seeds
  * 520 g (18.3 oz) bread flour

**Toppings**
  
sesame seeds
  
poppy seeds

**Directions**
  
Mix rye starter, filtered water and whole wheat flour in a bowl. Wrap the bowl with cling wrap and let sit in room temperature for 18-20 hours, until <a title="What an active pre-dough looks like" href="/what-an-active-pre-dough-looks-like/" target="_blank">the pre-dough is active, looking nice and bubbly</a>.

While the pre-dough is getting active, cook 1 cup of jasmine rice according to the instructions on the package. Let the rice cool.

Mix in the cooled rice with the pre-dough, re-use the cling wrap and let the bowl sit in room temperature for another 2 hours.

Add sea salt, honey, poppy seeds and bread flour to the pre-dough, and knead to a firm, slightly sticky dough. Shape into two loaves and put them in two greased loaf pans. Cover with a kitchen totwel and let rise until they have doubled in size, 2-3 hours.

Preheat the oven to 460°F. Brush the loaves with water and sprinkle sesame seeds on top. Place the loaves on the lower rack of the oven and throw in 2/3 cup of water on the bottom of the oven. Bake the loaves for 25 minutes. Then turn down the temperature and continue baking the loaves until they have a nice color and are cooked all the way through, about 20 minutes. <a title="Knock, knock.
