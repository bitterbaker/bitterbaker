The only hard part about baking with sourdough is getting an active (bubbly) starter. For some reason, the rye is always easier than the white wheat starter. It took me forever before I figured out a sneaky way to get my wheat starter going.

Take some of your <a title="How to make your own rye sourdough starter" href="http://bitterbaker.com/how-to-make-your-own-rye-sourdough-starter/" target="_blank">rye starter</a> and put in a clean jar. When it&#8217;s feeding time, feed it with 50 g (1.7 oz, not fluid!) of filtered water and 50 g (1.7 oz) of white bread flour. Let it sit 24 hours and repeat. Eventually, as you use and bake with the starter, only feeding it white bread flour, it will automatically turn into a white starter.
