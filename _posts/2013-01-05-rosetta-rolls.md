**Ingredients**
  
_Day 1_

  * 135 g rye starter (4.8 oz)
  * 370 g filtered water (13 oz, not fluid!)
  * 200 g bread flour (7 oz)

_Day 2_

  * (1/3 cup sugar)
  * 1/3 cup canola oil
  * 0.5 tbsp sea salt
  * 2 tbsp honey
  * 540 g bread flour (19 oz)
  * 2 eggs

**Toppings**
  
poppyseeds
  
sea salt
  
sunflower seeds

**Directions**
  
Mix starter, water and bread flour in a bowl and wrap it with cling wrap. Let sit for 24 hours until the <a title="What an active pre-dough looks like" href="http://bitterbaker.com/what-an-active-pre-dough-looks-like/" target="_blank">pre-dough is active, looking nice and bubbly</a>. Add (sugar), canola oil, sea salt, honey, eggs and bread flour. Knead to a firm dough. Divide the dough into 16 pieces. Roll out each piece to a string, 10&#8243;long. Tie a knot in the middle. Stick one end in underneath the knot, and the other end on the top of the knot (<a title="How to roll a rosetta" href="http://bitterbaker.com/roll-a-rosetta/" target="_blank">see how to roll a rosetta</a>). Let the rosetta rolls rest two hours.

Put a casserole dish with water in the oven and preheat it to 460°F. Brush some water on the rolls, and sprinkle your toppings over them. Bake the rolls for 15 minutes until they have reached an inner temperature of 207°F and sound hollow when you knock on the bottom.
