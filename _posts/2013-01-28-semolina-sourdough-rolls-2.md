**Ingredients**
  
_Day 1, poolish_

  * 100 g (3.5 oz) white starter
  * 350 g (12.3 oz, not fluid!) filtered water
  * 225 g (7.9 oz) bread flour

_Day 2_

  * 100 g (3.5 oz, not fluid!) filtered water
  * 0.5 tbsp sea salt
  * 2 tbsp honey
  * 105 g (3.7 oz) semolina flour
  * 395 g (13.9 oz) bread flour

**Toppings**
  
olive oil
  
semolina flour
  
poppy seeds
  
sea salt

**Directions**
  
Make the <a title="What a poolish should look like" href="/what-a-poolish-should-look-like/" target="_blank">poolish</a> by mixing starter, water and bread flour in a bowl. Wrap the bowl with cling wrap and let sit in room temperature for 20 hours, until <a title="What a poolish should look like" href="/what-a-poolish-should-look-like/" target="_blank">the poolish has risen, and then collapsed</a>. Add in water, sea salt, honey and semolina flour. Then add the bread flour and knead to a firm dough.

Roll out the dough to a rectangular shape, approximately 28”x17” (<a title="How to roll a twirly top" href="/how-to-roll-a-twirly-top/" target="_blank">see pictures here of how to shape the rolls</a>). Brush olive oil on the dough and sprinkle over semolina flour and poppy seeds. Fold the dough in half, roll it out a little further and cut it into stripes, about ¾ of an inch wide. Then shape the rolls. Put them on greased oven trays and let rise for about 2-3 hours.

Preheat the oven to 460°F and put in a casserole dish full of water on the lower rack. Brush olive oil on the rolls and sprinkle some sea salt on top. Bake the buns for about 20 minutes. <a title="Knock, knock. Who can tell me when my bread is done?" href="/how-to-know-when-the-bread-is-done/" target="_blank">See here on how to know when your bread is done</a>. Let the rolls cool on a rack.

_The looks of a sweet cinnamon roll (my style), with the benefits of pull-apart monkey bread, and with the taste of a soft semolina roll. Everybody wins._
