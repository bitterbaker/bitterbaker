These little scones are a wonderful combination of thyme, spelt flour and flaxseeds. Perfect for accompanying a spicy chili, or, like we had, roasted corn chowder (with sriracha!). Best of all – they only take 30 minutes to make!

_Fresh thyme works awesome in scones._ 

Scones are one of my favorite baked goods. I grew up having scones on lazy Sunday mornings, or on a rainy fall evening, along with a bowl of soup. Usually unsweetened or savory – it actually wasn&#8217;t until I moved to the States that I had sweet scones.

_Got some lonely soup that needs a partner?_

Top them off with soft butter or a slice of white cheddar if you want to make it even more delicious, otherwise I really just enjoy them exactly the way they are.

_Baked goods that take under 30 minutes are always a keeper!_

**Thyme Spelt Scones**
  
_Total time: 30 minutes. Makes 4 large scones._

**Ingredients**

  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">2 cups spelt flour</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 cup dark rye flour</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">2 tsp salt</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">4 tsp baking powder</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1re<img src=;">½ cup flaxseeds</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">5 sprigs fresh thyme</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 stick butter (113 g), room temperature</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 ¼ cup buttermilk</span>

**Instructions**
  
Preheat the oven to 485°F. Mix all the dry ingredients, including the fresh thyme, in a bowl. Add the butter to the mix with your fingers and make it into a crumbly dough. Mix in the buttermilk, either with your hands or a spoon.

Divide the dough in four pieces and flatten each piece out to the shape of a round cake, 5-6 inches wide. Do this directly on a greased oven tray, the dough will be really sticky! Take a knife and cut a cross in each scone – this way it will be easier to break the scones in quarters when they’re done.

Bake in the oven for 10-13 minutes until they have a nice color. Enjoy fresh out of the oven!
