**Flaxseed buns**

**Ingredients**
  
_Day 1_

  * 195 g white (6.9 oz) sourdough starter
  * 500 g filtered water (17.6 oz, not fluid!)
  * 340 g of bread flour (12 oz)

_Day 2_

  * 518 g (18.3 oz) bread flour
  * 2/3 cups flaxseeds
  * 1 tbsp sea salt
  * 2 tbsp honey

**Toppings**
  
sea salt
  
canola oil

**Directions**
  
Mix starter, water and bread flour in a bowl. Wrap the bowl with cling wrap and let sit in room temperature for 24 hours, [until the pre-dough is active, looking bubbly](http://bitterbaker.com/what-an-active-pre-dough-looks-like/ "What an active pre-dough looks like"). Add sea salt, honey and flaxseeds. Mix in bread flour until it starts to feel like a dough. Take up the dough on your working bench and knead it further. Divide the dough into 16 pieces. Roll little buns and place on a tray. Let rise for 2 hours.

Put in a casserole dish with half an inch of water in the oven. Preheat it to 460Â°F and bake the buns for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. The buns should sound hollow when knocking on the bottom.
