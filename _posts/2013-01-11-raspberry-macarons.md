These are the first macarons I have ever tried to make. Have to say they don&#8217;t look like the ones in the cookbook; <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Macarons-Cupcakes-Cake-Pops-Ohrn/dp/145490576X" target="_blank">Macarons, Cupcakes and Cake Pops</a>, but they are super delicious! Kind of taste like meringues.
