You won&#8217;t believe how easy it is to make this double almond cranberry spelt loaf. First of all, you don&#8217;t need any yeast. Second of all, you don&#8217;t need to do any kneading. Third – you don&#8217;t need to wait for the dough to rise. Pretty much unbeatable, I&#8217;d say.

_Delicious buttermilk loaf._ 

Plus, it&#8217;s a pretty healthy loaf, too. I only used spelt flour in this loaf, and added a bunch of almond flour and sliced almonds. You won&#8217;t believe how soft and moist it is! It&#8217;s so good. And if you toast it&#8230;. do I even have to tell you it only gets better?

_You can almost see how moist it is._ 

This loaf is pretty high up there among my top favorites. You can never go wrong with an easy, tasty buttermilk loaf. If I know myself (and I think I do), you&#8217;ll probably see a few more of these quick breads.

_The crust will be almost blackened, but don&#8217;t worry – the inside is awesome._

**Double almond cranberry spelt bread**
  
_Total time: 5 minutes to mix ingredients. Then 1 hour and 45 minutes to bake the loaf. Makes 1 loaf._

**Ingredients**

  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">2 cups buttermilk</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 can whole berry cranberry sauce (14 oz, or 397 g)</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">2 cups almond flour</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 cup sliced almonds</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">½ cup pumpkin seeds</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">½ cup flaxseeds</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">3 cups spelt flour</span>

**Instructions**
  
Preheat the oven to 390°F. Mix the buttermilk with the cranberry sauce in one bowl. In another bowl, mix all the dry ingredients. Stir in the dry ingredients in the buttermilk/cranberry sauce mix. Grease a loaf pan and pour the batter/dough in it (it will be kind of loose!). Bake the loaf for 1 hour and 45 minutes, until it has reached an inner temperature of 97°F, or 206.6°F.

Take the loaf out of the pan and let cool on a rack. Let it cool thoroughly to prevent the inside from being gooey when you cut it.

Enjoy!
