Some time ago (and when I say some, I mean a few months), I bought soy flour. It just glared at me from the shelf. Ooo, I thought to myself – imagine all the things that can be made! Pastries, breads, scones &#8211; you name it. The ideas rushed through my head and buy the time I made it to the cashier, I had already visualized an array of protein loaded baked goods.

Then the real me took over. Sometimes that initial shower of ideas just kind of wears off by the time you get home from the grocery store to unpack your bags. Since then, the soy flour has just been sitting in the back of a shelf, feeling lonely and left out because it hasn&#8217;t been used as often as the flaxseed meal.

_Breakfast anyone?_

You&#8217;ve probably already guessed where I&#8217;m going with this. Yup. I finally made my soy flour bread. The crust is strong and chewy, and the inside is on the denser side with a nice sourdough taste to it. It&#8217;s a great white loaf (with more protein than &#8220;normal&#8221; bread) to make sandwiches out of, or to toast and serve with marmelade. So if you just happen to have soy flour in your cupboard, now you know what to do with it.

_Top them off with your favorite seeds &#8211; two strong candidates for me are sesame seeds and poppy seeds!_

**Soy flour bread – mini loaves**
  
_Total time: 10 hours to let the pre-dough get active, then another 6 hours to let the dough rise and bake the buns. Makes 9 mini loaves._

**Ingredients**
  
_Day 1_

  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">100 g (3.5 oz) white starter</span>

_Day 2_

_Doesn&#8217;t even look like it&#8217;s healthier than &#8220;normal&#8221; white bread, does it?_

**Instructions**
  
Mix starter, water and bread flour in a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest in room temperature for 6-10 hours. Add sea salt, honey, soy flour, whole wheat flour and finally bread flour. Knead to a dough. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and let the dough rise in room temperature for 3 hours.

Divide the dough into 9 pieces. Shape into mini loaves, dip the bottoms in oat bran, and put in a greased mini loaf pan. Let rise for another 2-3 hours. Preheat the oven to 450°F. Brush the mini loaves with water and sprinkle over sesame seeds and poppy seeds. Spray some water on the bottom of the oven before you put in the mini loaves. Turn down the temperature and bake at 390°F for 20-25 minutes until the loaves are golden brown.

Take the loaves out from the loaf pan and let them cool on a rack.
