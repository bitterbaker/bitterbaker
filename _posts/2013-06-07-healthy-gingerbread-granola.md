I&#8217;m head over heels about this granola recipe! Does gingerbread granola in the middle of (fine, beginning of) summer sound kind of crazy to you? I promise you it&#8217;s not. This granola needs to happen in your kitchen. Today. You&#8217;ll thank me later.

_Plain yoghurt, raspberries and homemade granola. My kind of breakfast!_

My mom found an old foodie magazine in their laundry room – which is where this recipe comes from. It&#8217;s by far the best granola recipe I&#8217;ve ever tried. All the hearty grains, seeds and nuts mix so well with the subtle flavors of the gingerbread spices. Even though it&#8217;s (almost) summer.

_A little bit of unsweetened shredded coconut adds another dimension to this healthy treat._

I&#8217;m so inspired to make more granola recipes now. It&#8217;s so easy! And so fun! And I don&#8217;t even feel guilty eating it since it&#8217;s so full of stuff that&#8217;s just plain good for you. Plus I like eating things that taste good for breakfast. Naa, good is not enough. I like eating _delicious_ things for breakfast. And this granola fits that category perfectly.

So, chop chop, off you go. Make that granola happen, right now.

_I made half of the granola without coconut, and I seriously can&#8217;t decide which kind I like better!_

**Healthy homemade granola with gingerbread spices**

_Total time: 5 minutes to mix ingredients. 25 minutes to roast granola in oven._ 

**Ingredients**

  * 2 cups oats
  * 2 cups rolled hot cereal, with multiple grains (<a href="http://www.bobsredmill.com/cereals/" target="_blank">here are a few good examples from Bob&#8217;s Red Mill</a>)
  * 1.5 tbsp gingerbread spices (a mix of cinnamon, cloves, bitter orange, cardamom)
  * ½ cup chopped walnuts
  * ½ cup chopped hazelnuts
  * ½ cup chopped almonds
  * ½ cup flaxseeds
  * ½ cup sunflower seeds
  * 1 cup water
  * ½ cup canola oil
  * 3 tbsp honey
  * ½ cup shredded, unsweetened coconut (optional)

**Instructions**
  
Preheat the oven to 390°F. Mix all ingredients except for the shredded coconut in a bowl. Spread out an even layer of granola on one or two oven trays (I used two since I can fit two trays in my oven). Roast in the oven for 25 minutes. Stir after every ten minutes, and keep an eye on the granola when five minutes is left, you don&#8217;t want it to burn! Let cool and then mix in the shredded coconut. Serve with fruit and yoghurt.

_Am I the only one who thinks these strawberries look fake? I promise you they&#8217;re not! Still can&#8217;t get over how fake they look though. Maybe there&#8217;s something wrong with my camera._
