**Ingredients**

  * 1/2 stick butter (ca. 55 g)
  * 1/4 cup canola oil (50 g)
  * 5 tbsp cocoa powder
  * ¾ cup all-purpose flour
  * almost 1 full cup of sugar (but more than 3/4)
  * ¼ tsp vanilla extract
  * 3 eggs

**Mocha frosting**

  * 2 cups of powdered sugar
  * 1 stick butter (113 g)
  * 2 tbsp cocoa powder
  * 1 tbsp instant coffee powder
  * 3 tbsp water

**Toppings**
  
shredded coconut

**Directions**
  
Beat the eggs and the sugar until the batter is light and fluffy. Melt the butter and mix it with the canola oil. Sift the cocoa powder through and mix it with the flour. Add butter, canola oil and vanilla extract to the egg/sugar batter. Then, add the cocoa/flour mix.

Grease a 9” spring form with butter and powder it with cocoa powder. Pour the batter in it and bake in the oven at 350°F for 20 minutes. Let it cool on the counter and then cut the cake into little pieces.

Make the frosting by melting the butter. Add powdered sugar, cocoa powder, instant coffee and water and mix it together with an electric beater. Spread the frosting on top of the love munchies and sprinkle some shredded coconut on top.

Enjoy!
