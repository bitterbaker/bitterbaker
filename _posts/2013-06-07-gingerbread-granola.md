**Ingredients**

  * 2 cups oats
  * 2 cups rolled hot cereal, with multiple grains (<a href="http://www.bobsredmill.com/cereals/" target="_blank">here are a few good examples from Bob&#8217;s Red Mill</a>)
  * 1.5 tbsp gingerbread spices (a mix of cinnamon, cloves, bitter orange, cardamom)
  * ½ cup chopped walnuts
  * ½ cup chopped hazelnuts
  * ½ cup chopped almonds
  * ½ cup flaxseeds
  * ½ cup sunflower seeds
  * 1 cup water
  * ½ cup canola oil
  * 3 tbsp honey
  * ½ cup shredded, unsweetened coconut (optional)

**Instructions**
  
Preheat the oven to 390°F. Mix all ingredients except for the shredded coconut in a bowl. Spread out an even layer of granola on one or two oven trays (I used two since I can fit two trays in my oven). Roast in the oven for 25 minutes. Stir after every ten minutes, and keep an eye on the granola when five minutes is left, you don&#8217;t want it to burn! Let cool and then mix in the shredded coconut. Serve with fruit and yoghurt.

_I made half of the granola without coconut, and I seriously can&#8217;t decide which kind I like better!_

_Am I the only one who thinks these strawberries look fake? I promise you they&#8217;re not! Still can&#8217;t get over how fake they look though. Maybe there&#8217;s something wrong with my camera._
