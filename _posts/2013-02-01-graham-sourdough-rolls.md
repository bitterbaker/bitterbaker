Prepare for some mouthwatering graham rolls. Just saying. Because if you love a thick, chewy crust, with lots of fluffy, moist bread inside, then this is the bread for you. And look at that rising! They&#8217;re basically jumping out of the spring form. If even just half of that energy gets into me, running a marathon would be a piece of cake.

_A hint of fennel and anise make these rolls complete._ 

**Graham dinner rolls**

_Duration: 12 hours to let the pre-dough get active. Then another 5-6 hours to let the dough rise and baking the buns. Makes 12 buns in a 9” spring form._

**Ingredients**
  
_Day 1_

  * 110 g (3.9 oz) rye starter
  * 440 g (15.5 oz, not fluid!) filtered water
  * 200 g (7.1 oz) bread flour

_Day 2_

  * 1 tbsp sea salt
  * 1 tbsp molasses
  * 1 tsp ground fennel
  * 1 tsp ground anise
  * 35 g (1.2 oz) flaxseed meal
  * 100 g (3.5 oz) graham flour
  * 345 g (12.2 oz) bread flour

**Toppings**
  
graham flour

**Directions**
  
Mix rye starter, filtered water and bread flour in a bowl. Stir well and wrap the bowl with cling wrap. Let sit in room temperature for about 12 hours, until you have an <a title="What an active pre-dough looks like" href="/what-an-active-pre-dough-looks-like/" target="_blank">active pre-dough</a>.
  
Add sea salt, molasses, fennel, anise and flaxseed meal to the pre-dough. Stir and start adding the graham flour and the bread flour. Let the dough rest in the bowl covered with a kitchen towel for about 2 hours, or until it has almost doubled in size.

Take out the dough on your working bench and divide it into 12 pieces. Roll out each piece to a round bun, dust it with graham flour and place in a greased spring form pan. Let rest for about 2 hours.

Put a casserole dish full of water on the lower rack of the oven and preheat it to 460°F. Bake the buns for 15 minutes, then lower the temperature to 390°F and bake another 20 minutes. Move the spring form to the lower rack of the oven and cook another 10 minutes, or until the <a title="Knock, knock. Who can tell me when my bread is done?" href="/how-to-know-when-the-bread-is-done/" target="_blank">dinner rolls are cooked all the way through</a>.

Lift out the rolls from the spring form and let them cool on a rack.

Enjoy, folks!

_Just break off a piece whenever you feel like it. Let it cool as one piece though, that keeps the bread moist longer._
