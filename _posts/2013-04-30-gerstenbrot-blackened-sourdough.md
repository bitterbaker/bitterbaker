_Day 1_

  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">40 g (1.4 oz) rye starter</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">265 g (9.3 oz) dark rye flour</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">265 g (9.3 oz, not fluid!) filtered water</span>

_Day 2_

  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">275 g (9.7 oz) dark rye flour</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">140 g (4.9 oz) bread flour</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">180 g (6.3 oz, not fluid!) filtered water</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">14 g (0.5 oz) sea salt</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">1 tsp active dry yeast (+ 1 tbsp warm water)</span>

**Instructions**
  
Mix rye starter, dark rye flour and water in a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in room temperature about 16-18 hours.

Add dark rye flour, bread flour, water, sea salt and active dry yeast (activate the yeast in 1 tbsp of warm water for a few minutes before you mix it into the dough). Work the dough with a mixer for 7 minutes, by hand at least 15-20 minutes. Let the dough rest in the bowl, covered with a kitchen towel, for about 30 minutes. Knead the dough further about five minutes with the mixer (or 10 minutes by hand).

_I usually slice these kinds of bread really thin. The crust is pretty thick so thin slices taste way better than thicker ones._ 

Grease a loaf pan and place the dough in it. Wet your hands with water and even out the top of the dough. Here comes the tricky part about this bread, if you have a flame torch, go right ahead and use that one! I don’t, so I turned my oven to broil and put the dough right underneath the heat for two minutes, until part of the dough was blackened.

After you have &#8220;burned&#8221; the dough, let it rise in room temperature covered with a kitchen towel for 70 minutes. Preheat the oven to 500°F. Spray some water on the bottom of the oven and bake the bread on the second to lowest rack for 15 minutes. Open the oven to let some steam out. Lower the temperature to 390°F and continue baking for 45 minutes.

Take the dough out of the loaf pan and bake another 10 minutes, this time at 355°F.

Let cool on a rack.
