I&#8217;ve been wanting to do crispbread for a long time now, and finally got around to it. I googled a few recipes online and it really didn&#8217;t seem that complicated, so I just mixed and matched a few ingredients.

I was not prepared for how long it was going to take though. It was like making gingerbread cookies. It took hours to roll out the dough and make it thin enough, then baking each tray in the oven, making sure nothing got burned (some of which did). Now we have so much crispbread it&#8217;s going to last forever.

_Eat it as it is, or put avocado, tomatoes and red onions on top._ 

**Sourdough crispbread**

_Duration: 24 hours to let pre-dough get active. Then another 4-6 hours to let the dough rise and bake the bread._
  
 _Makes &#8230; enough._

**Ingredients**
  
_Day 1_

_Pre-dough:_

  * 145 g rye starter (5.11 oz)
  * 500 g filtered water (17.6 oz, not fluid!)
  * 70 g dark rye flour (2.5 oz)
  * 150 g bread flour (5.3 oz)

_Parboiling:_

  * 410 g boiling water (14.5 oz, not fluid!)
  * 40 g flaxseed (1.4 oz)
  * 30 g wheat bran (1 oz)
  * 70 g dark rye flour (2.5 oz)

_Day 2_

  * 1 apple
  * 2 tbsp honey
  * 1 tbsp sea salt
  * 1/3 cup canola oil
  * 50 g dark rye flour (1.8 oz)
  * 100 g graham flour (3.5 oz)
  * 50 g light rye flour (1.8 oz)
  * 1 tbsp anise seeds
  * 550 g bread flour (19.4 oz)

**Topping suggestions**
  
sea salt
  
pumpkin seeds
  
poppy seeds
  
sunflower seeds
  
sesame seeds
  
caraway seeds

**Directions**
  
Mix the ingredients for the pre-dough in a bowl and wrap it with cling wrap. In another bowl, mix flaxseed, wheat bran and dark rye flour for the parboiling. Bring the water to a boil and pour it over the ingredients. Stir and wrap with cling wrap. Let both the parboiling and the pre-dough rest for 12 hours, then mix the two together in one bowl. Reuse the plastic wrap and wrap it around the bowl. Let the dough rest for 12 hours.

Add grated apple, honey, sea salt, canola oil, dark and light rye flour, graham flour, anise seeds and bread flour. Knead the dough and let it rest in the bowl for 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 480Â°F. Cut the dough into little pieces. Roll out one pieces to thin (super thin!) pancake, and put the whole thing on an oven tray. Cut it into pieces with something sharp, like a pizza slicer. Brush the pieces with water and sprinkle on your choice of toppings (see <a title="How to make crisp bread" href="http://bitterbaker.com/how-to-make-crispbread/" target="_blank">pictures of how to make crisp bread</a>). Bake for 5-8 minutes. Make sure to keep an eye on them after 5 minutes, they burn easily!
